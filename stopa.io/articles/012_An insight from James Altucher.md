# An insight from James Altucher


> But there’s that Zen story: A man goes to a Zen master and says, “I would
> like to move to this city. What do you think of the people here?” And the
> Zen master says, “What were the people like in your old city?” And the man
> says, “They were awful, mean, spiteful.” The Zen master says, “they are the
> same here. You shouldn’t move here.” Then another person goes to the Zen
> master and says, “I’d like to move to your city. What do you think of the
> people here?” And the Zen master says, “What were the people like in your
> old city?” And the man says, “They were very nice people. Very smart. I
> enjoyed being around them.” And the Zen master says, “They are the same
> here. You will enjoy it here.”
