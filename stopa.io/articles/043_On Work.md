# On Work


I had the pleasure to meet Daniel Burka today.

You could tell the enthusiasm he had for what he was doing, and you could also
tell something that’s very rare in people.

Whether we talked about clients, or methods of learning, he was focused on
being excellent. From stories of making many, many variations, to the way he
prefered to work with people, it was all about striving to make something
great together.

A lot of designers aim to just get their work done, but being excellent is
much more then that. It’s being on the same team as your clients, doing the
best you can with them, on the same team. Standing up for your decisions,
coming in with curiosity and a drive to create something together.
