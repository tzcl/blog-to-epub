# Big stretches of time


One of the biggest reasons I find myself in procrastination with hard problems
is when I don’t give myself ample time to work on them.

Say you wake up, and you have a meeting at 11, and another meeting at 3. It
may seem like you have a lot of time for the rest of the day to spend on a
hard problem, but your brain knows better. It’s too afraid to start because it
knows you’ll be interrupted.

Avoid these types of schedules if you can; perhaps bundle all calls / meetings
on one day, or towards the night.
