# When to make your move


When I was 17, I applied to two universities; the best ones in Canada, and got
into both of them with scholarships. I ended up choosing not to go, and took a
bunch of opportunities that I thought were excellent for growth.

When someone young asks me if they should drop out though, I often advise
against it. I’ve been thinking about why that is —

I think my story can be contrived as courageously taking a bunch of risks, but
that’s not the case. I had been working with computers since I was 10, and
trying to build businesses for years before that. I didn’t jump into the
abyss, I jumped into someone paying me money to learn. Afterwards, I didn’t
jump into the abyss, I jumped into working to build a business in China with a
veteran.

If you’re young, and you want to make a jump, I’d advise against jumping
straight into the abyss. Instead, work harder at getting better at your craft.
As you get better, opportunities will come up, and instead of the fear of
jumping into the abyss, you’ll be dealing with the fear that you’ll be missing
out on thousands of opportunities unless you go.
