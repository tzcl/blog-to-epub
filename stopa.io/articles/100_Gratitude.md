# Gratitude


I feel like I’m held up by giants.

My father.

My mother.

My sisters.

My mentors. You know who you are :).

My friends. You know who you are :).

It’s scary to ask of people. I’m always scared to do that, but when I do, I’m
astounded with how many people I have who support me.

Thank you. You know who you are!
