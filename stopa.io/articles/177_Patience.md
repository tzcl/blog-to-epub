# Patience


Stupid decisions get made when one thinks that something has to happen, now.

The reasoning is usually that if it doesnâ€™t happen now, it will never happen,
ever.

This is true for only 1% of problems. For the rest, patience will get you
there. Know, with full confidence, that you will get what you want, with
effort ant patience.
