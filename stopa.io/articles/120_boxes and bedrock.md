# boxes and bedrock


I’ve spent the last month or so in Georgia with my sister, celebrating the
birth of her new child.

Though I love the culture here, there are some spots that rub the the wrong
way — particularily when it came to wealth building.

I’d get into a few arguments about it. On reflection, I think I might be off.

See, for me, the subject we would talk about could be imagined as a beautiful
modern box. The answer was clear to me.

When I talked to them, I would reply immedietly with my beautiful modern box
answers.

But, during a moment of reflection, It dawned on me that I was just preparing
answers, and wasn’t trying to understand what they were saying.

All of a sudden it wasn’t a box anymore, it was bedrock. It had curves that
were edged by large rivers for over hundreds of years. There was moss growing
on the rock. Animals would use this rock for shade, and it would continue to
change over decades.

It was complex, there was no process to fit it in.

I began to _understand_ them.
