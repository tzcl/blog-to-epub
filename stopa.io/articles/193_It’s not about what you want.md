# Itâ€™s not about what you want


Many people want to be successful in business. Many people want to be
excellent coders. Many people want to have great relationships. When I look at
those that are the best in their craft, it is not their desire that sets the
apart from the crowd. It is their clear understanding of _what it takes,_ and
their resolve to _do what it takes._

Want to be great in business? Prepare to be doubted by many. Want to be an
excellent engineer, prepare to face the limits of your knowledge, prepare to
sound dumb many times over. Want to be great at relationships, prepare to face
rejection.
