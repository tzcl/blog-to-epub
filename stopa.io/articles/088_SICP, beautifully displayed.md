# SICP, beautifully displayed


On top of my list of programming books are Introduction to Algorithms, and
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming.

For me, when reading textbook-style writing, it’s important to have 2 things:
the first, an easily digestible way for me to consume the media and know where
I was at last. Second, an accountablity trigger.

Fortunately, Eden and Aaron, two great friends that I mastermind with, were
also into reading SICP. We ended up starting a group learning campaign.
Because we’re all across the world, we’re using it as more of a way to keep
eachother in check, and to ask about the tough questions during debriefings.
This is the best plan in my opinion.

If you’re thinking of giving it a read, you need to check out

. It’s beautifully structured, which makes the whole experience 10 times more
fun.
