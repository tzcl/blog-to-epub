# My favorite books


Yesterday at lunch, our teams interns and me started talking books, and the
hour flew by. At the end a task was opened up to share some favorites. Here it
goes üòä

 ** _Books that have influenced my thinking the most_**

  * Antifragile by Nassim Taleb ‚Äî _goes over the idea that in certain domains, the extremes are what matter, I base a lot of my life on the philosphy that stems from that_

  * Principles by Ray Dalio ‚Äî _Dalio‚Äôs rules for operating at life and business. I loved his idea of ‚Äúthe machine‚Äù of achieving your goals, and how many interactions can be generalized as ‚Äúanother one of those‚Äù. Aside from his concepts, I stole his idea of a Principles list, which I keep, and a Situations List._

  * The Red Queen by Matt Ridley ‚Äî _fascinating book, about the constant race that occurs within species through sexual selection._

  * Stoic authors: Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, A Guide to the Good Life ‚Äî _From these authors I gained the idea of focusing on what we can control. I also love how these philosophers were doers, their philosophy is rooted in reality. A great essay to start with is ‚ÄúOn the shortness of life‚Äù by Seneca_

  * Models by Mark Manson ‚Äî _Philosophy book disguised as dating advice. I gave this to my sister I liked it so much! The main idea is to be vulnerable and real in relationships_

  * Getting Things Done by David Allen ‚Äî _David spent all his life perfecting the way to manage your life and work ‚Äî his ideas have influenced pretty drastically how I operate on a day-to-day basis_

  * Feeling Good by David Burns ‚Äî _If you find yourself having a lot of ups and downs in mood, this book helps greatly. His ideas for the way which we misperceive reality was an eye opener for me._

  * Essays by Paul Graham ‚Äî _I think PG‚Äôs thoughts are going to last the test of time. Many ideas on building wealth, friendships, hacking, and painting are keystones to my philosophy. I even made[a book](https://github.com/stopachka/pg-essays/tree/master/book) from it once to make things easy_

 ** _Fiction I have re-read over and over again_**

  * Taiko by Eiji Yoshikawa ‚Äî _This goes over the story of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, it‚Äôs a tale of historical fiction I found so rivetting, and had me researching a lot of Japanese history : >_

  * The Count of Monte Cristo by Dumas ‚Äî _I‚Äôve read this book multiple times, with the first time being when I was about 13. Each time, I see a different side of this story. It‚Äôs an 18th century tale of badassery, where the protagonist just kicks bum_

  * The Works of Rafael Sabatini ‚Äî In a span of 5 months I read 30 of his books. They‚Äôre all simple plots, but nourish the adventurer, and the hero within you. I‚Äôd recommend you start with Captain Blood, then Scaramouche

  * The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho ‚Äî _The idea that we are all one, and a part of the ‚Äúsoul of the world‚Äù, is something I‚Äôve grown to internalize_

  * The Prophet by Khalil Gibran ‚Äî _This is the only poem-book I have found to like. Such beautiful verse, it‚Äôs a pleasure to re-read_

 ** _Some fun books_**

  * Chimpanzee Politics ‚Äî _This book got me diving deep into a bunch more books on chimps. Rivetting story about a tribe that was being studied. Many applications to human behavior._

  * The other side of the leash ‚Äî _A book on dogs and how they think. Called my parents afterwards and asked them to get a dog_

  * Total Recall by Arnold ‚Äî _Arnold has so much raw ambition and belief in himself, it‚Äôs pretty astounding. Have read many of his books, and found them invigorating_

 _Leaving the best for last‚Ä¶._

The Life Changing Magic of Tidying up by Mario Kondo :). Will turn many slobs
into masters of cleaning

* * *

Oky doke, those are the main recommendations that come to mind. I wrote from
memory to make sure these were _really the books I liked, and not the ones I
wanted people to think I liked :). This is a snapshot of my mind in August
2018_

 _Update 2020_

About 2 years have past. I would add 2 books and a series to this list:

  * Hazlitt's Economics in one Lesson & Hayek's Road to Serfdom. The ideas in these books show with clarity and precision just how much our world is ruled by higher order effects. In the macro, intentions and our first assumptions lead us astray. These books catalyzed a journey of reflection and reading for me. At the end of it, I formed a more nuanced world view, which respects what we can't understand. It needs to be the right time. If you are deeply wondering just how the world works, these are the books to start out with.
  * The Wooster series by P.G Wodehouse. His writing is a joy to experience. You can't help but laugh through the chapters, and he makes it all seem effortless.

Finally, a call to action: _any book recommendations for me? :)_
