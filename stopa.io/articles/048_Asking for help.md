# Asking for help


I realized something recently —

I always thought that if people wanted help, they would ask me.

I was also always too shy / scared / proud to ask others people for help.

….

Eureka!

 _Everyone thinks like that._

An easy way to counteract this, is to ask people how you can help them. That
gets into the right conversation, helps people develop deeper and happier
relationships.
