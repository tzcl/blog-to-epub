# Trying not to try


I was sitting in a bar today, and I thought for a little bit. When I wasn’t
aware of what was happening around me, everything was simpler. Even if I
wanted to pretend now, I can’t ever go back to that. Even not trying is trying
not to try.

So, there’s no going back. Now, you we have to immerse ourselves enough that
we got to the other side. Is there some other way?
