# The Biggest Lever


How do you help the ones you love the most? Money’s not the biggest lever,
neither is taking over control, it’s empowering them.

Ask, what skills are they missing? And help them get it. It feels great when
you start seeing them take action, put their future in their own hands, you’re
anxious a lot less.

In fact, apply this to yourself too. Always ask what skills and paradigms
you’re missing, don’t just go for the magic pill.
