# Love people who tell you the truth


It’s very easy to hate people who tell you the truth. We wouldn’t have phrased
the sentence this way unless it was a truth that we don’t want to hear.

They could be people who see talent in you and push you, or see you neglecting
skills and habits that are good for you. You agree with them of course, but
there’s a reason you’re not doing them, and it’s not a rational one.

The anger you show is anger directed to yourself. You probably realize it a
few hours later, but you can’t take back words you said. It might be the most
imperative thing to learn, to see this as it’s happening, stop, and thank the
people who love you and are looking out for you.

With their guidance, and only with their guidance, could you get to where you
want to go.
