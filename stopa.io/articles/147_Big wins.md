# Big wins


We’re familiar with compound interest in finance, but I think this idea can be
applied more generally. There are skills we can learn, that act as compound
interest for our life.

For example, if you’re into programming, and you’re a developer, if you learn
to touch type when you’re a kid, you get all these wins for the rest of your
life, for free.

Similarily, if you learned to dress well, or read by habit, or ask for advice,
write great emails, or set up great finances, these skills and habits will
continue to pay back dividends for the rest of your life.

When looking for improvement, see if you can knock one of these habits out
first.
