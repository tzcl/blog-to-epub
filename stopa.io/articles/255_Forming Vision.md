# Forming Vision


What do you want to do with your life?

Many of us haven‚Äôt stopped to ask the question. When we try, we find the
answer doesn‚Äôt come so easy.

Why? Our lives are filled with opportunity. We can move to any city, work in
any profession, and pursue just about any hobby. [1]

At this level of optionality, where do you start? It gets more confusing too.
As you contend with these choices, an invisible hand biases all of your
decisions. This is the hand of society: through prestige and status, it can
get us to do just about anything.

Yet, we only live once. Should we spend our lives following the whims of
society, thrown about in this tempest of choice? How can we silence the noise
and find what we uniquely want to do?

Here‚Äôs how I think about it.

## Bottom Up

Start bottom up. Instead of surveying all the choices ahead of you, just ask
yourself: what are you doing _right now?_

Take a few hours and jot down all your to-dos in a document. Maybe you need to
send a gift to a friend, call a family member, or finish a feature. As you jot
these to-dos down, you‚Äôll build up a snapshot of what your priorities are
_right now_.

Here‚Äôs how this looks like for me:

(There are about a hundred other tasks like this)

Once you finish jotting the to-dos down, clean them up and clarify them. Work
over them until you feel like you know exactly what‚Äôs ahead. When you finish,
you‚Äôll feel a sigh of relief.

At least for the next few weeks, you know what to do now.

## Themes

Now you see a few weeks ahead. You can stop here, or you can go further. This
snapshot can serve as a foundation for your longer-term goals.

Go through the to-dos once more, but this time look for patterns. Do some to-
dos clump together?

Take note of why: Maybe you‚Äôll notice that a lot of to-dos clump towards
relationships. Or you have a clump about improving your craft. Or finance. Or
family.

Once you finish, you‚Äôve just revealed your active ‚Äúthemes‚Äù in life. Like it or
not, these themes are what you are prioritizing and are likely to impact over
the next year or two.

Now, let‚Äôs tame them.

How are you doing in each theme? Where do you think they‚Äôre heading over the
next year or two? Do you like where they‚Äôre headed? Are there some themes that
are unimportant to you, that you should drop? Perhaps most importantly, are
there some themes that you want to impact, but they don‚Äôt show up in your
priorities?

Answer these questions, change the themes around, and you‚Äôll end up naturally
forming your goals over the next few years.

Here‚Äôs how these look like for me:

## Vision

We started off with to-dos, sprouted themes, and even have goals for the next
few years. We now have a much better sense of what we value.

Can we take it further? What about 5 years or further?

We face the same challenge: the world is so dynamic it‚Äôs hard to think about
what 5 to 10 years ahead looks like. Here‚Äôs a different way to look at it:

Pick some age that‚Äôs interesting to you, maybe ~5 years ahead. Now, instead of
thinking about all that you‚Äôll have done by then, ask yourself: _what does an
ideal day look at that age?_

You‚Äôve reduced the solution from all achievements to just one slice: a day in
the life. To figure this out, you can start with grounded questions: What time
do you wake up? Where do you wake up? Is someone with you? What does your
house look like? What do you look like? What‚Äôs the first thing you do?

And so on. Here‚Äôs what this looks like for me:

![image](https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0LzEwMzEwMzMyNC00ZDg0OTY4MC00NWVlLTExZWItOWU0ZC1kZjcxOGIwYzM2ZDAucG5n)

As you write this, you‚Äôll constantly surprise yourself. The themes you figured
out will start coalescing into long-term direction, and sprout up in the
essay. You may start with apparently frivolous things, and discover that they
represent a much deeper idea.

The best part is, that these documents react to each-other. You may find new
themes that sprout up in writing your this reflection, which will affect your
mid-term goals, which will affect this reflection all over again.

You now have a vision at least 5 years ahead. Because you started with your
real to-dos, you know it‚Äôs grounded in reality, and since you pruned based on
how you felt about each theme, you know you‚Äôve avoided at least some of the
trappings of society.

## Taste

Wow, from just to-dos we‚Äôve gone 5 years ahead. What do we do from here?

As you experience reality, you‚Äôll get more and more information about what you
intrinsically value. You‚Äôve thought so deeply that you can more confidently
ask the larger questions life: from what‚Äôs important in society to how you can
help. To get a sense of what this kind of information can look like, here‚Äôs a
question to get you started: who are the people you respect, and why?

Keep these documents alive. Integrate your experience and evolve your ideas.
You may go in directions you would never have thought of. I doubt the 5 year
plan will work out as you expected when you write it. But, it can help you
reveal your preferences, your values, and act as an anchor in the tempest of
change.

You have only one life. I hope you live it doing what you love, amongst people
you love.

## Addendum

A lot of people and a lot of books have influenced my thinking on this. I
think David Allen‚Äôs ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMaking it all Work‚Äù, are
responsible for many ideas in this essay. Ramit Sethi influenced the ‚Äúfocus on
now‚Äù, and PG influenced ‚Äúbottom-up design‚Äù. I no longer follow GTD (my
productivity looks much more similar to pmarca‚Äôs
[advice](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_personal_productivity.html)), but I
suggest diving into all of these authors üôÇ.
