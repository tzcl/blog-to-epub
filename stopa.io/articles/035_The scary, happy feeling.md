# The scary, happy feeling


It’s scary to ask someone for help, because you find out where you stand. It’s
possible that they don’t help you and stop liking you all together.

But, when you are helped, it’s an excellent feeling. You are not alone, you
feel gratitude, conversely, more people will help you.

So help others, and ask for help
