# On criticism and insults


First, ask

“Is what this person said true?”

If it is, what is there to be insulted about? Be thankful, and treasure this
person. And then act.

For insults, consider

“Who is the person insulting me?

Do you respect them? If you do, then they aren’t insulting you, they are
criticizing you, which is something you can treasure. If they aren’t someone
you respect, then can be glad you’re doing something they disapprove of :).
