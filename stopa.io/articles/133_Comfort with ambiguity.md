# Comfort with ambiguity


This has been the hardest trait to train for me, because it’s so rare to come
by, and when you do the nature of the problem makes you want to end it
quickly.

Oh, ambiguity.

The pain of not knowing can be so bad, that we can count ourselves out just to
save ourselves from waiting.

But, the gains come from developing comfort with it, understanding it,
reveling in it. This is the time that you’re stretching.
