# Accidents


Who’s fault is it when an accident prevents you from doing what you needed to
do?

Maybe your wifi dies out the last minute you need to get something in. Maybe
things get shuffled around, and you need to deliver earlier then you expected.

It’s your fault — why leave things to the point where an accident can screw
you up? Build accidents into your plans.
