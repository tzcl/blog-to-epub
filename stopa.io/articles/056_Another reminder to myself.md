# Another reminder to myself


I was speaking to my mom, and she was telling me a story about how she was
frustrated with something.

I kind of over-reacted, tried to fix the problem, call her out when I thought
she was wrong — etc.

She’s super kind and gracious, so she didn’t say anything about it, but I know
that’s now what she was looking for. She was looking for someone to listen to
her.

When I next speak to someone, first, I’ll make sure that I can be fully
present. Second, I’ll ask myself what the other person’s objectives are, and
what I’m trying to accomplish by talking
