# The poem


The poem advanced  
For eons and eons it flew  
In rhapsody it grew  
Itâ€™s majesty unwritable  
With no ears to hear  
Until one day, the poem yearned for a listener  
So it drew verse upon verse  
And a pattern emerged  
From those patterns came more patterns still  
So that one noonday,  
A pattern of patterns took stock of what they saw  
And for a moment  
Heard the eternal tune
