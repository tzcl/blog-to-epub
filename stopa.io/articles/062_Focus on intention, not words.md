# Focus on intention, not words


When you speak, it’s often easy to be afraid that another person might
misinterpret what you’re saying. I’ve found that this very fear kind of builds
on itself — your conversations aren’t as crisp, and people can notice.

Try to simply make sure the intention is correct, and say what you like. If at
any point it’s misinterpreted, just lightly correct it, without taking
offense. You are certain in your intention, so speak with it.
