# On Communicating Clearly


When you communicate clearly, you take risks:

Ostracization.

Breaking rapport.

Looking dumb

But,

To truly form a group, you must have opinions others disagree about. If you
don’t risk ostracization, you can’t form groups in the first place.

To truly build rapport, you must agree on something others disagree about. If
you don’t risk breaking rapport, then you can’t strengthen it.

To be smart, you must have opinions that others think are wrong. If you don’t
risk looking dumb, you can’t even be smart.
