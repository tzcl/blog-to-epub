# Opaque decision making


There are certain large decisions, where unless you are comfortable with
making them in an opaque environment, you’ll always be putting them off,
waiting for the right time, the right information.

For example —

  * When will your large project launch?
  * When will you see your parents?
  * Should you take this flight to be there for your friend?

It’s scary to make the time commitment. Even though you know it’s the right
decision in the abstract, at each individual period of time there will be
something that stops you from doing it. Unless you realize that this will
happen forever unless you take action.
