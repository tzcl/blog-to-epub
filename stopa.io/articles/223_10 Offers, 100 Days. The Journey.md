# 10 Offers, 100 Days. The Journey


In November of 2018 I kicked off a job search that lasted 100 days. I went
through 11 onsites at companies like Google, Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, Amazon,
Square, Stripe ‚Äî you name it and I did an onsite there. Out of the 11 I landed
10 offers, and ultimately chose Airbnb.

 ** _In this essay I‚Äôll walk you through that journey: everything from the
spark, to the prep, the surprises, the work, the negotiation, and the ultimate
decision._**

My hope is first and foremost that you‚Äôll find the story entertaining üòä.
Second, I hope this gives you an insight into how the senior engineering job
search looks like ‚Äî I found little information that discussed what mattered
the most at this stage, and I aim for this to open up new ways of thinking for
you. Third, if you want to go deeper, I hope you check out
<https://jobsearch.dev>, a free video course we made that lays out the tactics
in detail. Finally, if you‚Äôre thinking about a job search, I‚Äôll share why you
should consider Airbnb and join ‚Äî it‚Äôs a phenomenal time to make a difference
here.

 ** _Without further ado‚Ä¶let‚Äôs get into the journey!_**

## The Backstory

 _Note: What follows is the story behind why I chose to do a job search in the
first place. If you‚Äôre looking for just the advice, skip to **The Advice**._

## Day -30: The Spark

November was a special month. I had just finished a 2-year-long project at
work called _The Great Migration_ , and approached my 5th year at Wit.ai, 4th
at Facebook. It was my birthday that month too, and it kicked off a lot
changes: I moved houses, booked a trip and‚Ä¶even bought an electric bike.

![](https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3N0b3BhY2hrYS9zdG9wYWJsb2cvYmxvYi9tYXN0ZXIvaW1nLzcwNC8wKmNBVmotZ2xMRlBmNm9jV18ucG5nP3Jhdz10cnVl)

I swear this isn‚Äôt a quarter-life crisis‚Ä¶

With all that change, I [reflected on my time at Wit and
Facebook](https://m.stopa.io/thank-you-wit-thank-you-facebook-8d5e7b55b777)
and saw a decision point. My team was ready, our product was mature, our infra
was stable(er), and _The Great Migration_ was complete. For the first time in
a long time I had a blank slate and could earnestly ask _‚Äî what‚Äôs next?_

## Day -1: The Decision

At first, I saw only one option: I would start a new company.

My end goal has always been to build a company with life-long friends that
takes a shot at a billion dollar problem. The time felt ripe. It was November
too, so I could take a short stint skiing and reading, then back to SF to kick
off the startup.

Yet, the more I spoke to close friends and mentors, the more I thought, the
more my eyes opened up to different options. I could go deeper at FB, or I
could join a new company, or I could do a sabbatical year, or‚Ä¶you get the
gist.

So what to do? I decided then that before I make a choice, I should get the
_best possible_ options in front of me. How do we do that? by kicking off that
job search!

## The Advice

 _Note: What follows is the most condensed form of advice I could write on the
job search, while keeping it fun and entertaining. I included personal stories
to illustrate points, and where it made sense I refer out to sections in
jobsearch.dev for more detail._

## Day 0: Foundations

To kick off the search, there are a few mindset shifts that if done well, can
make everything else simple. In fact, I‚Äôll venture to say that some of these
mindset shifts when generalized can change your perspective‚Ä¶ on life itself!

Okay okay that‚Äôs a serious statement, but give this a read, try it yourself
and let me know what you think after üòä.

###  **Foundations I: Attitude**

Most people _dread_ the job search. They think it‚Äôs a kind of performance, and
_‚Äúthey just want it to be over with‚Äù._ This kind of attitude can shoot you in
the foot. If you dread something, you‚Äôre less likely to invest the time needed
to get _great_ at it. That can produce negative experiences, which reinforces
your opinion and causes a spiral of bad outcomes. Plus, if you _‚Äújust want it
be over with‚Äù_ you‚Äôre more likely to choose the first few offers and miss out
on the opportunity that‚Äôs _really_ right for you.

Let‚Äôs shift this. **Learn to love the job search _._** You can look it as an
infrequent, leveraged opportunity for you to grow. This is your chance to
select _exactly_ the right next move for your career. It‚Äôs one of the best
times to negotiate your role and your compensation. Plus, it‚Äôs a great
opportunity for you to expand and deepen your relationships: you‚Äôll lean on
your community throughout the search and meet many talented people at some
amazing companies.

Well, that‚Äôs a lot of real good reasons to love the job search. Internalize
this attitude, and every step that follows turns into a meaningful part of
your life story.

###  **Foundations II: Community**

Most people treat the job search as a solo activity. They apply for jobs by
themselves, they negotiate themselves, and they choose themselves. I think
this is because people associate asking for help with _dependance,_ and
they‚Äôre afraid to make themselves vulnerable.

Now, this is fine, it‚Äôs an _independent mindset._ But we can go further. Let‚Äôs
**shift to an interdependent mindset _._** Think about it, teams achieve great
things, not individuals _._

 **Form a team around your search** and involve them in every phase **.** Who
are the mentors who can show you what you didn‚Äôt know you didn‚Äôt know? Who are
the peers that can train you and give you advice? Who are friends who can
refer you to the right companies? Engage them from the start.

For example, as you saw in [**The
Decision**](https://m.stopa.io/10-offers-100-days-the-
journey-16a0407b8d95#1c0b) ** _,_** before starting the search I met up with
friends and mentors to get their advice on what to do. I can honestly tell you
that these conversations opened paths I could never have _conceived_ before.
**People who champion you can give you ambitious advice that you may be afraid
to see** , and that changes the game **.** A special shoutout to my previous
co-founder and life-long friend Sebastian Marshall, whose strategic advice
changed was invaluable to me at this stage.

When I did start the search, I created a document that tracked the companies I
was aiming for, alongside todos. This made it easy to share where I was at
with my community, and easy for my community to discover ways they can help.
Through this I received referrals at all 11 companies I aimed for.

When I began, two friends took the time to write up detailed advice from their
last job search. Many, many friends took the time to train me. One of them was
12 timezones away and made time to skype for hours. They showed me where the
bar was at, and gave me the feedback I needed to iterate.

![](https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3N0b3BhY2hrYS9zdG9wYWJsb2cvYmxvYi9tYXN0ZXIvaW1nLzcwNC8wKnhtU2gweTl5RndmY3k4Q0sucG5nP3Jhdz10cnVl)

Had 1 day in New York, 3 life-long friends took the time to give me personal
training

Abraham Sorock, Alex Reichert, Andrew Wong, Daniel Woelfel, Giff Huang, Jacky
Wang, Kam Leung, Mark Shlick, Robert Honsby, Sean Grove special shoutouts for
the support and advice you gave me üòä. There‚Äôs many more ‚Äî if you‚Äôre reading
this and I haven‚Äôt included you, it‚Äôs mainly because I thought you preferred
privacy ‚Äî let me know and will update!

You‚Äôre starting to get a sense _how_ interdependent this was. If I listed
every person, I think it would surpass a hundred people. I truly believe if
you embrace this mindset and look at problems as a _team,_ you‚Äôll see a huge
change in all you go for, not just the search.

###  **Foundations III: Narrative**

We get to the final part of the mindset, _how you look at your career._ Most
people, if you ask them ‚Äú _Why are you looking for a new job‚Äù,_ will give you
either a generic answer ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a change _‚Äù,_ ‚ÄúI want to be
impactful‚Äù, or some negative story _‚Äî_ ‚ÄúI was bored _‚Äù, ‚Äú _I didn‚Äôt like X_‚Äù.
_This hurts you in at least three ways. First, it‚Äôs what everybody says, and
it demonstrates that you haven‚Äôt thought deeply about your career. Second, it
makes it hard for people to help_. _If you tell your mentors ‚Äúyou‚Äôre looking
to be impactful‚Äù, that doesn‚Äôt narrow much down, and They can‚Äôt just open up
their rolodex to email every company they know. Third, it makes it impossible
to be a _strong fit_ for any company. What can a recruiter note down if you
say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre looking for a change‚Äù, which will let them think you‚Äôre a perfect
fit for their company? If you‚Äôre looking for _any company,_ then by definition
you can‚Äôt be a _strong fit_ for a specific company.

Instead, let‚Äôs shift your viewpoint and take charge of your career. **Look at
your career as an adventure.** Sit down and reflect: What got you here? What
did you _love_ about your last job? What would the most _amazing_ opportunity
look like? As you go deeper, you‚Äôll discover reasons that will get your
thrilled, and show you how unique and awesome your path has already been. It
will make the search a lot more fun, it will make it easier for people to
help, and get recruiters _very_ excited about you. Most importantly, it will
change how you think about yourself and your career. Let me be clear, this
isn‚Äôt some trick to change your viewpoint artificially. If you dig deep,
you‚Äôll discover _real,_ true reasons, and that will reverberate throughout
your life.

## Day 1 ‚Üí 5: Kick Off

Okay, now we‚Äôve learned to love the job search, we see it as a team endeavor,
and we have a strong conviction about our career. It‚Äôs time to kick off the
search. To do that, let‚Äôs do two things:

###  **Kick Off I: Communication**

In every interview you do, people aim to extract _signal_ and _scope_.
**Signal** is what _demonstrates_ that you can do your job ‚Äî from coding to
designing systems. **Scope** is what demonstrates _the kinds of problems you
can take on ‚Äî_ do you lead a team, a team of teams, or the whole org?

The combination of signal and scope is what determines your level _._ Your
level, and where you fall on the spectrum is the most leveraged decision for
determining your compensation and the kinds expectations you have.

Many people get annoyed about this. It feels very bureaucratic. Why should
some number define you? You may also know people who have ‚Äúhigh levels‚Äù but
produce less. Thinking this way can hinder you. Another way you can look at it
is this: it‚Äôs how things are for now, and it‚Äôs the best way we know so far to
align your skills with the company. Let‚Äôs lean in and work with it.

Your goal for the first 5 days is to **form a conviction about your level.**
Go over expectations, and prove to yourself that you are the level you are. If
you want to do go deeper on this, visit our course and see the ‚ÄúCommunication‚Äù
module ‚Äî it gives you a leveling guide to calibrate. Once you‚Äôve done this,
update your resume and LinkedIn to communicate that level. When you speak with
recruiters and interviewers, you should be able to freely communicate it as
well. Finally, go to levels.fyi, and form a conviction about the kind of
compensation ranges you‚Äôre looking for too.

###  **Kick Off II: Schedule Screens**

From consulting with your community and forming your narrative, you should
have about 10 or so companies that you could see yourself being _thrilled_ to
work at _._ Now, engage your community and find a referral for each company.
You can do this by searching through your LinkedIn, or sharing a document of
your top choices with your community and asking them if they know people who
can refer. Do the best you can to go through referrals, as having someone to
champion you helps in many ways throughout the process. If you can‚Äôt find
someone, it‚Äôs okay to send a direct application, but do that as a very last
resort.

With all recruiters, ask to schedule a screen about 20‚Äì30 days in advance.
They may be surprised, but you can tell them you want to prepare, and that
will send positive signal too. With that, you‚Äôll have a deadline, and a real
good reason to start studying üòä.

## Day 5 ‚Üí 30: Preparation

Now comes the hard work. It‚Äôs time to ramp up for the technical interviews.

###  **Preparation I: Key Mindset**

The mindset at this stage I want to stress, is to _give it all you‚Äôve got._
Sometimes, as a way of coping with rejection, people give themselves an out ‚Äî
‚ÄúOh I didn‚Äôt really study anyways‚Äù. My suggestion is to **frame your success
on how hard you prepare,** not on the results. Aim to remove _any reason to_
say, you didn‚Äôt try your absolute best.

Fun story on that ‚Äî months before the search, I had trip planned with one of
my closest friends to go to Israel and Jordan, and it fell right during
preparation time‚Ä¶

![](https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3N0b3BhY2hrYS9zdG9wYWJsb2cvYmxvYi9tYXN0ZXIvaW1nLzcwNC8wKjdzcU1PQXhXcFFWNVRpWXkucG5nP3Jhdz10cnVl)

Elements of Programming Interviews, 6am at a Bedouin camp

Well then, we need to travel and study at the same time üôÇ. A special shoutout
for Jacky Wang for being such an awesome travel partner, and being an
encourager for the studies every day. Jacky‚Äôs the kind of guy who not only
pushes the envelope to explore (just check out his
[photos](http://jackywang.org)), but he‚Äôll indulge and converse with
excitement about programming questions _for hours_ on long car rides!

###  **Preparation II: General Advice**

There are three pieces of advice that apply generally to all interview types.
First, the process to study: I recommend self-study first, then schedule
practice interviews, then try the real thing, then calibrate and repeat the
process if necessary. Second, **approach every interview as if you are solving
the problem for real _._** Most people seem to ‚Äúpretend‚Äù when they solve the
problem. They may not go deep enough, write code that won‚Äôt run, explain
things for the sake of explaining, or create a system that won‚Äôt scale.
_Imagine a team at work set up a meeting and asked you to solve the problem,_
and act accordingly. Third, most people are blissfully unaware of what an
_excellent performance_ looks like. They assume the interviewer will read
their minds and see how amazing they are. As you can guess, this won‚Äôt work.
Study each interview type deeply, and get feedback on how you‚Äôre doing from
your peers. Calibrate, make sure you are aware the bar, and you are well above
it.

 _‚Ä¶ **Now, for some more specific advice**_

###  **Preparation III: Algorithm Interviews**

Unless you‚Äôre a specialist, this is the interview type to master first. No
matter how skilled and senior you are, algorithm interviews play a significant
role. I suggest you pick one book ‚Äî Joe and I prefer [Elements of Programming
Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-
Insiders/dp/1537713949/) ‚Äî and work through it linearly every day (personal
nit: skip the first chapter in this book on bitwise operators, this is the
most annoying part of the book, and isn‚Äôt needed for most interviews). If you
get stuck on a question, just look at the answer, but make sure to write it
with your own code, line by line. By the end of it, you‚Äôll be surprised with
all that you learn, and I guarantee you, at least if you go through this book,
you‚Äôll rarely be asked a question that you can‚Äôt map to something you‚Äôve
learned.

One common pitfall here is, people go on leetcode and do a bunch of random
questions. I suggest avoiding this ‚Äî since the questions are random, you won‚Äôt
see improvement quickly, and you may not learn what‚Äôs needed. Leetcode is
great though for finding and doing specific questions.

A week or so after you‚Äôre into the book, schedule practice interviews. My
favorites are <https://interviewing.io> and <https://pramp.com>. A special
shoutout to the founder of interviewing.io, Aline Lerner. There was an obscure
19 year-old on hackernews who was having trouble coming to the U.S. She took
the time to help, and even gave him free access to her lawyers. That 19 year-
old was me, and I am still grateful üôÇ.

The third or fourth week, schedule practice interviews with your friend group.
This is where you‚Äôll _really_ get a sense of where you‚Äôre at. If the feedback
is positive, you‚Äôre ready for the screens. If not, _move them. Y_ou‚Äôll be
surprised how many times you can do that. We go quite deep on this, and the
kinds of questions you should be able to answer, in the ‚ÄúAlgorithm Interview‚Äù
module of jobsearch.dev.

###  **Preparation IV: UI Interviews**

For UI Engineers, I suggest three steps. First, get comfortable with online
editors, you‚Äôll be using them all the time, so you should be able to set up an
environment quickly. Second, ramp back up on some UI concepts that you may not
have worked on recently ‚Äî things like drag and drop, selection apis, etc. If
you‚Äôre looking for more specific inspiration, we‚Äôve included some homework in
the ‚ÄúUI Interview‚Äù module of the course. Third, explore the latest and
greatest in JS ‚Äî look up what interests you ‚Äî from react hooks to all that‚Äôs
new in GraphQL. If you‚Äôre looking for some courses, [Wes
Bos](https://wesbos.com) has some great content to ramp you up. The key to
these interviews is to demonstrate your ability to build UIs and your love of
UI engineering. If you follow these steps it‚Äôll come through naturally.

###  **Preparation V** : **System Design Interviews**

For System Design, I also suggest three steps. First, master the _structure_ ‚Äî
scope down, go broad, outline a complete solution, go deep on as many
components as you can, then go the extra mile, to share how you would actually
launch the system. The ‚ÄúSystem Design‚Äù module in the course does a great job
of going deep on this. Next, as you go through the practice interviews, you‚Äôll
start to notice places where you can improve. Start noting those down and
build a plan to learn. For example, if you don‚Äôt know how to scale, you can
search ‚Äú{Company Name} InfoQ‚Äù and find some awesome talks. If you‚Äôre unsure
about concurrency, the book [7 concurrency models in 7
weeks](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Concurrency-Models-Weeks-
Programmers/dp/1937785653) can ramp you up. Don‚Äôt know much about databases?
[7 databases in 7 weeks](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Databases-Weeks-Modern-
Movement/dp/1680502530). Pick what interests you and start going deep. This is
my favorite interview type, because as you go deeper, the skills and knowledge
you learn transfers into making you a better architect.

###  **Preparation VI: Experience Interviews**

The purpose of the Experience Interview is to understand your _scope ‚Äî_ the
kinds of problems you can solve ‚Äî and whether you are a culture fit. This
interview type largely takes care of itself if you‚Äôve centered on your
narrative (you know what you want and where you‚Äôre going), and your
communication (you know what level you are). The first coneys your culture
fit, and the second your scope. You can go deeper on this in the ‚ÄúExperience
Interview‚Äù module in the course.

###  **Preparation VII: How to Focus for these 20 days**

Now you‚Äôve got an outline of each kind of interview, and how to prepare. For
the first 20 days, I suggest focusing heavily on Algorithms. If you‚Äôre a UI
engineer, still do algos, but spend maybe 30‚Äì40% of the time building UI
components too. You want to focus on this because the screens are mainly this
type of interview. As you pass the screens, you‚Äôll have to go deeper on
systems before you head into the onsites.

## Day 30 ‚Üí 60: Execution

Okay, we‚Äôre now ready to execute. Over the next month, you should be finished
with all your screens and on-sites.

###  **Execution I: Key Pieces**

Three key pieces of advice here:

Come in to every interview with a positive mindset, and **treat everyone with
class**. These people could become your friends, and it‚Äôs fun to learn about
how a company works. Come with that mindset, and the confidence will seep
through.

 _Batch all the interviews._ **Make sure all the screens and onsites are
scheduled around the same time**. The preparation you can do part time, but
this piece Joe and I highly suggest, you figure out how to do full-time. When
offers land around the same time, you‚Äôll have a lot more leverage.

 **Communicate your level and your narrative** _._ Keep signal and scope top
of mind, and communicate clearly during every phase ‚Äî recruiter screens,
technical screens, and and onsites. We go deeper on this in the ‚ÄúInterview
Phases‚Äù module of the course.

###  **Execution II: Dealing with the Unexpected**

As you go through the onsites, two things can happen:

 **You‚Äôll fail at some interview**

As you may have noted, I did 11 onsites, and got 10 offers‚Ä¶that means I failed
one of em üòÑ. _Even with some of the most intense prep, sh *t happens_. When it
does, do not over-react, embarrass yourself by being mean, or change your
plans and cancel all upcoming interviews _._ Instead, treat everyone with a
smile and with class. Then, be kind to yourself, take out what lessons you
can, and _continue on with the plan_. If you see failure on more than one or
two interviews, consider re-scheduling and re-calibrating.

 **You‚Äôll get something unexpected**

Life can throw curve ball at anytime, and you‚Äôre unlikely to avoid it during
the job search. Case in point:

![](https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3N0b3BhY2hrYS9zdG9wYWJsb2cvYmxvYi9tYXN0ZXIvaW1nLzcwNC8wKlFkb29WRGNCTEJDRGMtRGUucG5nP3Jhdz10cnVl)

Don‚Äôt try huge jumps on your skis, when you don‚Äôt know how, especially during
your job search

On Christmas break, Joe and I went skiing. I did an unintended backflip, and
landed in the ER. When something like this happens, again, avoid over-
reacting. Treat surprises as an opportunity to be malleable, and make it part
of your story. For example, the day I visited the ER, I had a conversation
with one of the best recruiters I‚Äôve ever met, Twitter‚Äôs Matt Robbins. I sent
him that picture, and I wager that will be the most unique recruiter
conversation either of us will have in our career.

## Day 60 ‚Üí 100: Choice

Around Day 60, offers should start to roll in, and it‚Äôs time to choose. The
first surprise that people may have here, is the number of days. Most people
take about a week or two to decide‚Ä¶Day 60‚Äì100 is 40 days! Does it really take
that long to choose a company, even after you‚Äôve received your offers?

Yes!

Let me be clear, this isn‚Äôt about negotiation. You‚Äôve already done 90% of the
legwork for that through your preparation and execution ‚Äî if you communicated
your level well, you‚Äôve aced the interviews, and you landed your offers around
the same time, you can safely assume every company will be competitive and get
you the best offer. There are specific things you can do at this point ‚Äî the
main advice being to use clear with what you would sign right away with. We go
deeper on this in the ‚ÄúNegotiation‚Äù section of the course. Patio11‚Äôs [Salary
Negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) and
Rands‚Äô [The Business](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-business/) are
great reading too.

The reason this takes so long is because the purpose for this phase is to
**_choose the company that‚Äôs the best fit for you._** It‚Äôs your turn to
interview back. Meet your team, meet your manager, really align on the kinds
of work you would do, and let your future team show you how they could be a
part of your narrative.

To give you context, Stripe, Airbnb, Square, and Google were my final choices.
I ended up meeting 6 managers at google, and visited Stripe, Airbnb and Square
offices at least 7 times each. By the end of these meetings, you‚Äôll have
formed friends, and have gotten a _great_ sense of what it‚Äôs like to work at
each company.

The final step before making the decision, is to get feedback from your
community. I suggest you **write out an essay that goes over your decision,**
and discuss with your peers and mentors ‚Äî do they agree with your thinking,
what do they see that you don‚Äôt, do they have any suggestions?

To get a sense of how this looks, here‚Äôs a compressed screenshot of the essay
I sent my friends and mentors: ‚ÄúOn Choosing‚Äù

![](https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3N0b3BhY2hrYS9zdG9wYWJsb2cvYmxvYi9tYXN0ZXIvaW1nLzcwNC8wKm1NOGhKNmFBY1lIOW5WMzkucG5nP3Jhdz10cnVl)

Don‚Äôt squint, it‚Äôs not meant to be read

It‚Äôs a bit too personal to share outright, but I wanted to give you a sense of
the kind of deliberation that went behind this: thousands of words, and
insights from more than a dozen of my closest friends and mentors. These were
amazing companies and the decision was close.

If you do this well, you‚Äôll have clear, strong conclusions for _exactly_ why
you would choose a certain company. Compensation will be far away from the
main reasons, and you‚Äôll be thrilled to sign.

## Day 100: Breathe

This will be a day where you breathe and realize how exciting, yet how tiring
things were. Take a break and plan a celebration with your community.

 **With that, we‚Äôve covered the advice üòä.**

## Final Notes

### An Ode to Joe Averbukh

I want to reveal something to you: any time I used the word ‚ÄúI‚Äù ‚Äî you can
replace it with ‚Äúwe‚Äù. Joe is my roommate and lifelong brother. Joe and I did
this job search together, and we‚Äôll both be joining Airbnb, in the same org to
boot! We spoke every day, discussed every single exchange and every single
idea, and supported each-other through all the highs and lows. Even writing
this essay was Joe‚Äôs idea, so if you got something valuable from this,
remember that at least half the credit goes to him!

### Want to go deeper?

If you made it this far, and you‚Äôre pumped, get ready to go deep into the
rabbit hole. Joe, Luba, and I, with the help of Aamir Patel and Jordan
Yagiello, expounded on all the lessons learned here, and created a video
course that will walk you through it all. From leveling guides, to example
narratives, to deep explanations on system design, UI interviews, and more,
you can get it there. **Best of all, it‚Äôs 100% free.** We were thinking of
making it paid course initially, but after some long talks, we wanted to share
this with our community üòä. Go to <https://jobsearch.dev> and see for yourself.
