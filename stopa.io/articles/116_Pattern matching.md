# Pattern matching


Recently I wrote a post about feeling
uncool(<http://www.stepanp.com/posts/158>). Though the conclusion is solid, I
was completely about initial thoughts.

In the span of the last few days, the people who I thought didn’t like me,
totally did. They were awesome, and we became great friends.

Why did I think they didn’t like me? I was pattern matching from childhood.
I.e These types of people are ‘cool’, they probably like to do x and y, so
they must not like me.

My head ran way too quickly. That’s an embarassingly dumb way to think, but
hey, it happens :P.

So to update, when you feel you’re not liked, it might actually not be the
case. Try to see if your pattern matching, and interrupt it.
