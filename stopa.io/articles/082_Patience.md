# Patience


This piece of advise can act against some people; If you have a lot of trouble
following up for example, this post may not be for you.

However, there is always the person that follows up to quickly or rashly, and
loses as a result. Why is that? What’s the difference between following up
well, versus being too forward?

I think it’s mostly about the intention behind the follow up. If you’re
anxious, it’s never a good idea to send an email or call. Notice how I didn’t
see, almost always, or some of the time. No, it’s ALWAYS a bad idea.

Follow up with when you’re level headed, and you’re doing it because it’s what
it takes to move the ball forward.
