# Try


I think a lot about living a life with no regrets. I think the key to this is
the philosophy to try your hardest, with anything you do. Know your odds, but
donâ€™t let odds influence how hard you try. Push every part of your being,
experience life completely, learn from mistakes, grow, get better
