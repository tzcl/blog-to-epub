# 2 types of pride


I don’t remember where I read this, but it stayed with me —

People can have two types of pride. The first prevents them from action. This
is what you see when people don’t do things because they consider it ‘below
their status’, or something like that.

The second prevents them from not taking action. This is when you need to do
something, because you said you would, and you’re too proud to go and make
excuses.

The second type of pride is worth it all, the first needs to be cleansed from
your mind.
