# Present Evaluations


I had this feeling, that got revealed to me while listening to a mentor speak.

Oftentimes, an X thing happens that gives us an advantage.

I operate on this X, and it works great, but it can become really troublesome
if I no longer have that advantage.

Itâ€™s hard to let go of X, and because of that you only choose things that you
would as though if you had X. But those are wrong choices, so it gets worse
and worse.

When making choices, make sure you are objective to your current state,
advantages and disadvantages.
