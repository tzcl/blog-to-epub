# To existential fears: the answer is in process


“What if I never make money, ever?” “What if I never find the love of my
life?” “What if I have no friends”

No matter what, we will invariably ask ourselves these questions. The knee-
jerk answer for me was to list out what I needed to have accomplished to not
feel that. X in the bank, etc.

But, as I come close to achievement, these fears are never assuaged. No matter
how far you go up, you can still fall down.

So, what to do?

Focus on processes. Have you mastered the skills of seeing where you’re bad,
improving, seeing what’s important and focusing on that. Are you able to
empathize with people, and be mindful of the ones you love? These skills can
never be taken away
