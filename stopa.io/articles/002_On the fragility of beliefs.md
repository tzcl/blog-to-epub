# On the fragility of beliefs


I had an interesting realization after talking to a friend I hadn’t seen in a
while.

Our entire lives are strung together by a set of beliefs. How we look at
making money, friendships, love, etc forms the construct of the way we see the
world, the way we see ourselves, and the way we interact with others. But,
these are just beliefs, they aren’t reality. Losing a belief can happen in a
flicker of an eye, and your entire life starts to dissassemble.

I’m beginning to see why the life of entrepeneurship leads people into mental
breakdowns! Our entire lives are basically beliefs that we set for ourselves,
and most of the time they aren’t validated by anyone else. That can get pretty
scary.
