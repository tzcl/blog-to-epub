# The Interpreter


You kick off  
A function in a sea of functions, variables and classes  
While with some you compose  
Many others you certainly oppose  
I mean c'mone, classes...you know they're assess

But you grow up, and you take a step back  
At the end of the day weâ€™re all just functions, you think  
Just a light facade, abstractions of one big hack

But you grow even more  
You listen to the rhythm  
And notice a much simpler algorithm  
Jump, subtract, add, that's the only score

No here, no there, no good no bad

Time passes  
And you feel the refactoring coming  
So you take a moment to assess  
For you know fear is unbecoming

All of a sudden it hits you

There's no jump, no add, no subtract  
Just electricity, flowing all at once, ever present  
Nothing abstract  
You smile, content

A poem, inspired by the idea that "our mind is the interpreter of reality"
