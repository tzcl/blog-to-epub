# Choose what bugs you


How well do you fit the vision of success?

What schools did you go to? What awards did you win? Where do you stand in the
pecking order? How do does your body measure up to the golden standard?

The pressure to conform. It can be debilitating, and it can be vexing.

Until you choose that is.

Choose what you believe your success is. Choose to stand _above_ what the
masses believe, not lumping on the side and hoping to find confirmation.

You can only feel the pressure when you _believe_ that success actually is
what’s in society’s common knowledge. Stand aside, and define the stick that
you measure yourself against.
