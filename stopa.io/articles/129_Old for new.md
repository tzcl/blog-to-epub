# Old for new


There’s an ironic correlation when building your relationships:

The more invested your relationship is, the more bs the other party will to
take from you.

Imagine forgetting to call someone you’ve just met for a month. Well, they’re
not your friend anymore. But imagine doing that to your mom, she’ll still be
your mom.

If we work by necessity though, we can find ourself investing much more in the
younger relationships, because of how fragile they are.

However, the older ones are much, much more valuable. They’ve been stress
tested. From thousands of new relationships, only a few of them will blossom
into your close, inner circle.

And then there’s family. The relationships you can never replace.

A good rule of thumb can be to invert how you spend time on your relationships
— 90 % family, 9% close friends, 1% new relationships.
