# Acceptance


Looking through you  
to where the child lies  
Eyes that can see  
You are superman  
You are beautiful  
You mean well

I was thinking about this after reading James Altucher’s book, “Choose
Yourself”([no aff link](https://www.amazon.ca/Choose-Yourself-
ebook/dp/B00CO8D3G4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1369946778&sr=8-1&keywords=choose+yourself)).
I think it’s his best work. It’s beautiful and uplifting to read, and the
daily practice works. The idea muscle works. Read that book :).
