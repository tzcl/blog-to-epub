# Don’t trust why you think you feel bad


Before you give into your imaginative mind’s explanation for why you feel the
way you do, ask —

  * Is your room clean?
  * Are you talking with your family?
  * Are you having 1 on 1 dinner’s with good friends?
  * Are you exercising?
  * Are you sleeping well?

Focus on those instead
