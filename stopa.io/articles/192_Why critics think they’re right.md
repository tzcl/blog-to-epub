# Why critics think they’re right

Most of the time, if you criticize some new idea, you are going to be right.
This is because the majority of new ideas are bad. If they were good, other
people would have done them already.

However, only _within the space_ of bad ideas lie great ideas. These are ideas
that were bad before, that now, because of something most people don’t see,
have become great ideas.

This is something I keep in mind, when I pick what to work on, or when I give
feedback.
