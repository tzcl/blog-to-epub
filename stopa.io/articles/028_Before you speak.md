# Before you speak


 _Note: this was a note to myself_

Before interacting with the ones you love,

Take a breath, close your eyes, and focus your entire mind on them.

Bring to bear the affection you have for them, your unconditional acceptance.

Imagine your were in their shoes and see with your mind’s eye what they must
be thinking about. With this mindset, enter the conversation, and truly
listen.

Make your goal to understand them as best as you can.

Than, without pushing, learn from them, and guide them the best you can.
Sometimes, the best thing you can do is to listen. Sometimes, it’s to comfort,
sometimes to guide, and sometimes to quietly help.

Approach life this way to develop a greater love of your family and the world,
and grow to see their happiness reflected onto you and vice versa.
