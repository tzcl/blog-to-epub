# On The Delivery


One of the tenets of my philosophy is to be unabashedly clear with my friends.
I don’t “like my friends for their faults”. I like them for their inner
selves, and point out the faults I see.

Sometimes, this can backfire. Instead of helping them, you shut them down
during their moment of vulnerability. It happens when I speak in absolutes. It
comes as a surprise, and does not accomplish anything.

This is a subtle reminder for myself, to remember how important the delivery
is. Keep the other person in mind, empathize, and say it well.
