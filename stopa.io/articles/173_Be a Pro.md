# Be a Pro


In software engineering, the current atmosphere is relaxed — you go at your
leisure, there are no real deadlines, you don’t have to take care of yourself,
you barely need to grow.

Compare how people approach software engineering, or any profession, to that
of an athlete. The athlete, is constantly pushing further, getting 1 on 1
instruction, being meticulous about form, extreme about discipline.

Let’s raise our standards.
