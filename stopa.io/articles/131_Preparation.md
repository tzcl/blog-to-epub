# Preparation


I wish I was Steve Balmer right now, so I can prance out of this computer
screen and shout “Preparation” “Preparation” “Preparation”!

Butterflies? Worried about something? Does the world seem unfair?

Step back. Heads down. You’ve just gotten fuel, and a todo list. It’s a lot of
fun, and at the end what you can do is all that will matter.

I feel like our brain can be stuck in the 50s. Yes, there was a time when you
needed some sort signaling to get what you want, but that’s not the case
anymore. You don’t need to signal, you can just show.

How?

By stepping back, putting your head down, diving deep, learning, iterating.
