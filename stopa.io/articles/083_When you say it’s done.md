# When you say it’s done


In high school, I had a friend who was a phenominal artist. He drew a portrait
of me, and it still hangs in my family’s house.

His portraits were extremely realistic. You could tell that not only he was
good, but he put thought and care in his work.

One day, I got to watch him create a piece of work. Two hours in, I was
surprised, because the work didn’t look that great. I felt like I could do the
same thing. But, he didn’t stop there. Two more hours, refining, refining. Two
more hours. Two more hours.

And then there came out a masterpiece.

When doing work, I try to remember this. If you want to create excellent work,
you’ll be going through a process. The first time it might not be so good.
But, don’t get disheartened, it’s a necessary step. Time to refine.
