# The Talent Excuse


I’ve seen this excuse in academia and in programming repeated over and over.

People just think they need to be born with it, and they can’t code or do well
in school otherwise.

There’s something to be said about talent, but that’s when you’re thinking
about how to be become the best programmer. Not in your community, but maybe
the world. Talent plays a role there.

But, when it comes to a standarized curriculum, or a skillset that millions of
other people have learned, it’s not about talent.

It can be about a lot of things — learning strategies, the right mix of
mentors, learning syles, which are all fixable.
