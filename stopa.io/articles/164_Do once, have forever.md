# Do once, have forever


There’s a special class of wins you can have in life, that have short calendar
time setup costs, but will win for you for the rest of your life. It excited
me just thinking about it.

Here are a few of them —

1) Get a kindle

2) Get a great checking account

3) Get a great savings account, and automate payments to it

4) Read The Beautiful Magic of Tidying up

5) Get a personal trainer

6) Set up a system to get laundry done

7) Set up a system to have fun stuff to do with friends on Saturdays

8) Set up trips throughout the year to see family, or do something
adventurous. Spend 2 days just buying all the plane tickets, and you have a
guaranteed good year.
