David Burn’s “Feeling Good” has been one of the most impactful books I’ve read
this year.

The key piece is that certain patterns in your thinking lead you to
misperceive reality and lead you into depression. These _rang_ for me. Seeing
reality more clearly can do wonders for a blue mood, but it can also do
wonders for almost any goal you’re aiming for.
