# The Blank Page


Learning new things, in it’s infancy has one of the wierdest qualities — it
takes a LOT of effort to just _start._

You do other things, anything to prevent you from sitting down, and trudging
through the confusion and discomfort that you have to face. With learning new
languages (both computer and human) and skills, you have to face this moment
of ‘f**, If only I could just use what I’m comfortable with, this would be
done yesterday’

But, inevitably, after an hour you get yourself in flow, things tick together,
and you can’t imagine going back.

Remember that when you start. The growing pains, unsurprisingly, help you
grow.
