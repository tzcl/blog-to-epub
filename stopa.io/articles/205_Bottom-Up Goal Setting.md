# Bottom-Up Goal Setting


When deciding what to do next, it’s common practice, to start top down. You
sit down and ask “Why am I alive?”, and from there working out what you should
do next week.

This is worth doing, but I have found that _what you are doing now_ is a much
better starting point for answering these questions.

It’s the “walking the walk” of your priorities. If you group your time, and
sort, you will see your priorities.

In that process, you will also see where the current priorities do not match
up to what you want, and there lies what to do next.
