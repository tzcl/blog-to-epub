# Oh my turn!


I’ve observed myself getting in this weird conversation pattern, even though I
don’t mean it. For example,

Person says they did X cool thing, or are learning Y thing.

I say oh that’s cool, I’m also doing X.

Or even worse,

oh that’s cool, I’m doing Y, which is like X but better

Now, I think it’s totally fine to talk about what you’re up to, but this whole
conversation becomes an strutting contest. Why not let them finish, see what
you can learn. Afterwards, after you really exhausted what they wanted to say,
then maybe continue the conversation about your experiences with X or Y.
