# The saddest thing about large companies


That saddest thing about large companies is that they’ve stopped believing
that they’re employees are competent decision makers.

I just got off from a sucky experience with Expedia and Virgin America. There
was a booking mistake that I made, but instead of 24 hours later, I found out
48 hours later.

Now this was my mistake, so you can imagine what a day they could have made
for me if they were accommodating.

I’ve flown over 100,000 miles in the last 2 years, and it was my first time
trying Virgin.

If the person on the other end of the call had any authority, they would have
made the right decision, instead they seem like any other airline to me now,
just a bit more flashy.

It makes sense how a startup can win. Every employee can make decisions, and
they right ones compound quickly.
