# Keep a ‘what’s my answer to this’ file


I’ve realized something that I’ve been doing only in a scattered way, but
every time I did it, it turned out to be a wonderful boon in my life.

In our lives, it’s pretty common to go over the same converation multiple
times. When that converation is an uncomfortable one, we predicatbly fail at
it every single time.

I.e when you meet someone, how do you start a conversation? Most people just
end up talking about what they do, and it’s not the best way to build rapport.
We think we’ll be creative in the moment, but we just end up saying the same
thing.

So, let’s keep a swipe file. How about ‘ Hey, how did you and X meet? ‘

Or, when speeking to a mentor at a conference, instead of blaberring about how
they’re your hero and ending the conversation, why not ask them ‘Hey, who do
you learn from?’ (Saw this is one of Ramit Sethi’s emails, this is gold).

These are generic to everyone, but where this comes in super handy is with
specific touchy points that some of us have. For me for example, it’s about
discussing University with my parents. I always end up becoming slightly
defensive, and can’t really convey my point across. Time to fix that!
