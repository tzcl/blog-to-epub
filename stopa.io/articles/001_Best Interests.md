# Best Interests
I’ve realized something crucial.

We’re cuddled. The reason we can do a lot of the things and take risks is
because we’ve been cuddled into an immense belief in ourselves.

When I was 10, I had no doubts that I was very intelligent, and strong, and
amazing, thanks to my mother’s love.

But, when we grow up, we don’t always interact with our mothers!

It can be dangerous to think that every person you meet has the same interests
that your mother has for you.

Every time someone says something, ask yourself, do they act differently to
what they say?

What were they thinking when they said what they said? Was it different?
