# The price we pay


I recently read Paul Graham’s [_Raising
Kids_](http://www.paulgraham.com/kids.html) _._ I loved the piece in its
entirety, but a few sentences sparked something within me.

He wrote about what he missed about life when he was younger:

> I remember perfectly well what life was like before.
>
> Well enough to miss some things a lot,
>
> …like the ability to take off for some other country at a moment’s notice.

I smiled with excitement when I read that. Yes! We have _so much_ freedom.

But…there was a twist. In a few poetic sentences:

> That was so great. **Why did I never do that?**
>
> …most of the freedom I had before kids, I never used.
>
> …I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used it.

Yes, yes. So much yes.

We have freedom. Yet we burden ourselves with faux responsibility or self-
inflicted urgency.

Think about it: what feelings come to you, when you imagine doing something
_for no reason at all?_

It can feel _wrong_ on so many levels. Yet, where where are we hurrying too?

The time when we have real responsibility will come.

The time where we _absolutely_ _must_ focus on one thing, in one place, will
come.

We’re already paying for the freedom we have. How can we embrace it?
