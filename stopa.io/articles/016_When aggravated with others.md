# When aggravated with others


i had a strong work session with my business partner yesterday. We got a lot
done, he set up a new marketing channel, we were preparing to outdo our
projections. However, for some reason, I was off the entire time; I felt
frustrated, and I pushed back on every corner and talked about how we were
task switching. Something interesting came out of this though.

When you’re aggrevated, are you really ever aggrevated with others, or are you
aggrevated with yourself?

That day I didn’t think I got much done, and the frustrations I brought up —
task switching etc — were what _I _was doing the most. Aggrevatation can lead
to some interesting insights in what you could improve at. Just make sure you
don’t fuck with other people because of it.
