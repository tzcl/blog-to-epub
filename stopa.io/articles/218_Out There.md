# Out There


Do what scares you  
Ask her that question  
Build what you dreamed of  
Sell

Risk the rejection

Face the feeling  
of your bare identity, exposed to the world

As you do this, take comfort

For this happened  
and will continue to happen  
in every place,  
in every generation,  
to man and woman,  
since human time

That feeling,  
when you feel the breeze,  
and look up,  
out of your mind, just for a moment,

sensing yourself at once bare and alone,  
but at the same time,  
connected,  
through that very feeling
