# How did you feel before it even happened?


It can be crippling to deal with events with high upside. You fret over losing
them. Worse, if you actually lose the high upside event, it really does hurt.

So what to do?

Imagine how you felt before you knew anything about that high upside event.

Didn’t you already feel pretty great? Did you love and were loved by the right
people?

Then, it follows that this high upside event is actually not as consequential
as you think. The worst case isn’t catastrophe, but pretty awesome.

So, go forward and take advantage of them, knowing you’ll be just fine either
way :)
