# Life is not a story


of being a nerd in school, and then rising up and kissing the cheerleader.

of struggle until you win and show your doubters wrong

of battles with others, of intense love.

Life is not a story.

A 2 hour epic is fun to watch, but we are trying to adapt those 2 hours to out
90 years.

If we focus and expect crecendos, we miss the more important space between
them.
