# Your perspective has nothing to do with reality.


One quote we used for a marketing piece somes this up the best —

>  **Money moves based on non-judgmental market forces, not morality.** The
> difficult truth is: Being a good person, being a better person, being an
> exceptionally talented person, making or selling the better or even best
> product, or delivering the finest service does not automatically entitle you
> to wealth… If you think that you should be financially rewarded because you
> are honest, hard-working, and kind to old people and pets, you’re in for a
> very disappointing life.

No matter how you feel about something, it doesn’t change that it’s going to
happen. This occurs to me in two situations. One, I practice something, and I
feel the pain, but I know it will lead to the results I want, and the actual
situation has no negatives in the first place. Two, I avoid something becuase
I don’t want to think about it.

A perfect example of the latter — In Taiwan I was having trouble finding
living accomodations, so I ignored it. Sleeping at the computer cafe was very
real…:P

The closer we get to professionalism and our goals, I feel like closer we are
to the reality of things.
