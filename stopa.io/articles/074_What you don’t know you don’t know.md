# What you don’t know you don’t know


Not sure I can give the whole credit to Taleb, but he strongly enlivened the
the idea I had in my head about Things people don’t know they don’t know.

When you already know something, you can take action against it, so it can’t
really hurt you, in that it won’t be a surprise.

However, there are inifnitely more things you don’t know you don’t know, which
is guaranteed to have an impact on you. Perhaps if you’re in technology, it’s
what you’re not learning that’s going to explode and become common place.

To expose yourself to the most positive outcomes, attempt to expose yourself
to as many things that you don’t know as possible.
