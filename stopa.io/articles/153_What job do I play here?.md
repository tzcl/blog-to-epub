# What job do I play here?


In recent conversations with family, I’ve found it super helpful to ask, what
job do I need to do here? What’s the purpose of this conversation? What will
make it a successful one?

There’s many a time where instead of arguing on specific points with my
parents, I should have realized the conversation was actually about getting
closer to them, learning more about them when they were younger, having fun.
