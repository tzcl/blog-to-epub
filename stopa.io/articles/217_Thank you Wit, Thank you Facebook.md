# Thank you Wit, Thank you Facebook


It all began with an email. I saw a small startup with an esoteric domain
name, and even more esoteric technology. They wanted someone who knew Clojure,
Rust, ML, React (before it was cool). I knew Ruby and Javascript from hacking
on my own projects. But hey, we gotta go for what we want üôÇ

From that email, I discovered a rag-tag group of people, out of which 3 of us
were learning Mandarin, and all of us were new to the U.S. We were weird in
the same way, and that was energizing.

In the interview we worked together and grabbed drinks afterwards. I was
slightly under 21 at the time, but thankfully because the U.S. has their date
format MM/DD/YY, my Canadian passport of DD/MM/YY got me through.

The day I met them, I knew this was the place for me. The CEO Alex and COO
Laurent were friends for over a decade, and leaders where I would learn from
_every_ conversation. The CTO Willy was one of the most talented engineers I
had met. The first engineer Oliv took care of me like a brother. Martin was
the most fearless engineer I had ever met, and one of the most caring friends.
Julien became a partner, as we grew together in _every way_. We were joined by
some of the most talented people I‚Äôve ever gotten to work with: Anthony,
Alexander, Jen, Aric.

## The Fateful Email

Soon after, we got an email from Facebook. Now, we weren‚Äôt looking, but when
David Marcus and Zuck send an email, you take the time to answer. 2 months,
and a few amazing lawyers later, we made it to Facebook

Is this the end or the beginning? Definitely the beginning

## The Journey Begins

When we came in, we got bit by the Facebook bug. Everyone was optimistic and
went for world-changing results. Even a mission like ‚Äúcreate an Assistant that
can answer any question‚Äù was plausible.

So, we tried üôÇ. We iterated and iterated, and the team expanded. We stole
Daniel away from an enticing offer from Google. Not sure how much he knows,
but I felt like we hit the jackpot when Spencer joined us. Kemal came to
change the game, Prince, Jing, Loredana, Henry, Sean, Brian, Cody transformed
us into two dream-teams.

This could only have happened at Facebook. David, Raymond I‚Äôm humbled by your
belief in us and in your leadership of Messenger.

Our teams built M, which soon turned into M Suggestions, now servicing
millions and millions of users every day. We took Wit forward and built it
into a tool that‚Äôs used by over one hundred and eighty thousand engineers.

Days before F8, there was some seerious work to do. Champagne helps

As we grew, Messenger grew with us, and we became a whole family. Yoram became
our director, one of the best mentors a I could have asked for. Nick, Helen,
Rajesh, and Weihu became my managers, and some of the best coaches I could
have asked for.

The core team expanded too. We nabbed Aleka, and she brought care and true
ownership to the entire Wit experience. Jason joined and infused a fearless
spirit into the team. Marion helped give Wit a real voice.

Alongside Wit, the M team grew. Anthony & Yarik were phenomenal technical
leaders, Yi Tong, Christopher, Mo Mo joined

Plus, we had some of the _best interns_. Tony and Pasha are blazing away at
Facebook as we speak, and many are on their way.

A full on family was formed

## The Journey comes to a close

After 5 years, and my entire 20s, I began to think about the next chapter. One
question I would ask though was this ‚Äî _are we ready?_

I‚Äôll tell you when I knew without a doubt:

Every year, the Wit team would go to our favorite restaurant, Da Sichuan.

Alex carries back Da Sichuan‚Äôs Ma Po Tofu sauce to France

Last year, we went as the a whole new team.

And heck, if that‚Äôs not enough, the team joined in on Georgian traditions‚Ä¶

I saw Wit was ready, and I knew in my heart I was ready too. I came to Wit as
a kid, and I leave as an adult. I‚Äôm grateful for every moment.

In my internal post, I left a piece of advice for those at Facebook, and I
thought I‚Äôd share it externally too:

 ** _Work and life is what you make of it. Come in with a positive attitude,
come in wanting to change the world, come in wanting to make life long
friends, come in ready to learn and grow. Do this, and watch how reality forms
around you._**

## Thank you üôÇ
