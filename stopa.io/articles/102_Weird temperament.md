# Weird temperament


I’m not sure this is universal, but I see this as probably one of stupidest
flaws I have.

I can be antaganous in conversation with people I love.

An example of what I mean — My family and I got into a conversation regarding
the merits of Europe and America. They noted off handedly that people in
Europe were more refined (this is paraphrased, we were speaking in Georgian,
and the meaning of refined is slightly different). I deliberately underminded
what they said, and made a very strong statement — like I _hate_ beauracratic,
class based systems.

Now, that was not what they meant. Thankfully, they’re my parents, and they
love me, and they don’t seem to share this temperament, so they calmly moved
the conversation elsewhere.

But why did I say that? I would usually defend this in the name of wanting to
convey something that will be better for the other, but today I realized
that’s not the case.

It could better be described as me trying to get a rise out of them.

But why?

Well, I guess the way to narrow the search is to look for things that were
outside of normal that day.

First, I had a sore throat.

Second, other things were on my mind.

Both chipped away at my frontal lobe, is the best way I can put it.

Presence and cognicance. Maybe it’s not even worth having a conversation
without them
