# On leadership, self-esteem, and confidence


Joe and I have a bit of a reputation. We‚Äôre known to have a high level of
self-esteem ‚Äî so much so that we‚Äôve been asked ‚Äú _how do we do it?‚Äù_ quite a
few times.

In this essay, I‚Äôll try to answer how I think about it:

 **A. Your goal is to convince yourself that you are a confident leader with
high self-esteem**

Your inner critic knows you best, and they‚Äôre the hardest to convince. Yet
they are the most important person that we need to convince: all our behaviors
and beliefs stem from there.

Now, you could try to convince your critic by describing yourself as a
confident leader with high self esteem: ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm confident, oh I‚Äôm a leader‚Äù

But your critic is too smart for that. If you try this the words will seem
hollow. After all your inner critic knows what you _really_ think.

To truly convince our inner critic we‚Äôll have to get more concrete: _what do
these words actually mean?_

To convince your critic, first

 **B. Identify the _behaviors_ behind self-esteem, confidence, and
leadership**

Take a step back and ask yourself: _what do these words mean to you?_

 **Self-esteem:** _To me, self-esteem means you have strong core values, which
you won‚Äôt change to appease other people. You are okay with who you are. You
are capable of being vulnerable and risking rejection, because you value your
self-opinion higher than those of the crowd._

 **Confidence:** _To me, confidence means, you go after ambitious goals
because you believe you are capable of achieving them._

 **Leadership:** _To me, leadership comes from taking care of other people,
empowering other people, thinking of others before yourself, doing the hard
work, inspiring others._

 **Now you can start to describe yourself with these behaviors**

Instead of I have high self esteem, you can say

  *  _I have strong core values_

  *  _I stand up for what‚Äôs right._

Instead of I‚Äôm a leader, you can say:

  *  _I am a person who looks out and takes care of people._

  *  _I am a person who coaches and empowers people._

At this point your inner critic will start to listen‚Ä¶but we‚Äôll need to do more
before it catches on. To truly cement those beliefs:

 **C. Prove out behaviors with your actions**

As life goes on, you‚Äôll come across _many_ opportunities to help others, to
stand up for what‚Äôs right, to dig the ditches and do the hard work.

To illustrate how frequent these opportunities are, let‚Äôs think about
something very simple. Say you want to meet your friends

  * Instead of waiting for people to invite you, take initiative and invite others
  * When you‚Äôre choosing where to eat, instead of asking yourself _where you specifically want to eat,_ ask yourself, _where your friends would enjoy eating the most_
  * When you‚Äôre about to order, instead of thinking about what you want to eat first, think, would the group like some appetizers or drinks?
  * Now say you arrive, and you notice one of your friends drops a fork: take the initiative and pick it up, ask the waiter to help
  * Say you‚Äôve been at this restaurant a few times, introduce yourself to the staff, and thank them for taking care
  * Say at the dinner there‚Äôs a pretty person you‚Äôre interested in, but they say something you disagree with. Stay strong and say what you think (I still struggle with this one :P)

These opportunities are _everywhere._ Notice them, pick them up, and all of a
sudden, your description of yourself gains strength. With that you can begin
to make the jump and tell yourself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident‚Äù. This time the words have
depth.

 **The best part of all of this is that your internal critic will change
roles: from _critic_ to _advocate_.** Initially, all they did was hold you
back. But, as you train them to describe you with positive and worthwhile
behaviors, the tone will shift: when something bad happens, they‚Äôll start
giving you reasons why everything will be okay, why you have the strength to
deal with this, why you will behave with class.

This will reverberate throughout your life.

 **End Notes**

 **1)** One thing that helps: _role models for these behaviors._

Personally, adventure novels (Scaramouche, Captain Blood) and anime (Naruto,
One Piece) left an imprint on me. I often think about what some of my favorite
characters would do in certain situations üòÑ.

 **2)** One thing to watch out for: _ego_

It‚Äôs easy to take this thinking too far and begin to think you are _special,
an exception._ You don‚Äôt have _actually_ pay the price, you‚Äôre born this way.
This is a recipe for disaster and it is very easy to fall into, especially
when you receive praise from others.

What helps me:

  * Remember that we are all one, a part of a community. It‚Äôs weird to say this, but in case you don‚Äôt already believe it: All human life is worth the same, no matter what we do.
  * Tie your self belief to your actions: it‚Äôs easy to _stop_ being a leader: all you have to do is let it get to your head and stop caring for other people.

 **3)** This may generalize

Thinking about it, this generalizes to a whole bunch of other characteristics.
How do you become a great communicator, or how do you become a great writer,
an exceptional engineer? The steps seem the same. Something to think about!

 **Prior Art**

  * James Clear talks a lot about the effect describing yourself can have in his book _Atomic Habits._ Highly recommend reading

  * My previous co-founder Sebastian Marshall would always tell me: judge yourself by your actions. This definitely played a part in my philosophy

And with that, we have a rough roadmap for leadership, self-confidence, and
self-esteem üôÇ
