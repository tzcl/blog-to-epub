# For better negotation, event out your relative times


This is something that many of us had a problem with — You’re waiting for an
email from someone, and a day passes since their latest reply. Anxiousness,
rises, another day passes, oh my god! Now theories start developing, and those
theories can lead you to your downfall.

This is due to the difference between your relative experience of time, and
their relative experience of time. To them, because they are less invested the
the days go by much more quickly. For you, you think about the event more, so
your days go by much, much slower.

For more effective negotiation, aim to be just _slightly_ faster then the
other person. This takes the benefit that you will be moving things forward,
but won’t sabotage yourself by trying to move too quickly.

How do you speed up your relative experience of time? Create other things to
think about. When your waiting on action from other people, ask yourself if
there’s anything else you can do. If you can, start working on that, and this
will push them to respond faster anyways. If there’s nothing you can do in
that campaign, do things that will increase your overall strength. If you’re
in a negotiation with a consulting client or employer for example, and there’s
nothing more you can do but wait, just coding on OSS projects is an excellent
use of your time, or learning a new skill.
