# Be friends with your clients


Sales can be seen as a very combatative endeveaur. To me, it still seems that
way, but the better I see people get, the more it’s about building lasting
friendships. Your clients should be people you can dine with at your home, and
you theirs. It’s the testament to you looking out for their needs, offering
them the best product, and overdelivering.
