# Knowing vs Doing


Ever since I was about 15, I kept a journal. It was my mode of reflection,
planning, and recording the ‘lessons’ of life.

There was a glaring pattern I noticed, which has influenced a lot of my
descision making. About 8 months ago, I was changing between notebooks, and
dealing with some challenges in business and personal life. As I was doing
this, I had a flash of insight and started writing a lesson about how to
interact with others. Out of curiosity, I also looked back at a few past
notebooks, and realized that I already wrote that lesson. It was as though I
was rediscovering everything all over again.

Almost all the challenges that I had, the previous me had the same answers to
them, but I had yet to implement them and the problems seemed different on an
artificial glance.

This is where the knowing vs doing seperation was so apparent to me. I could
know the right way, but consistently act in the wrong way.

Knowing isn’t enough. That’s a big part of it, but implementation takes much
longer, much more awareness and effort.
