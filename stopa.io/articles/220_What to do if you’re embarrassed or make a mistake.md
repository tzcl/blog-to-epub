# What to do if you’re embarrassed or make a mistake


My friend recently did something a bit embarrassing. For the last few weeks,
it’s been bugging them to no end. They would recurrently remember, feel guilt,
feel ashamed, give themselves remonstrations, and the cycle would keep
repeating.

We spoke about this, and I thought I’d share the advice more generally:

Whenever you make a mistake, I think two things happen:

 **1)** You over-fixate on yourself, like that action you took is _all_ that
matters in the world.

 **2)** You start giving yourself _highly critical and mean_ self talk

 **For 1),** Try to get out of your head.

Do something nice for _another_ person. Remember that, at the end of the day,
even with the worst possible thing for you, it’s just some small part of
somebody’s life. _Most things are inconsequential_

 **For 2),** Imagine your self-talk turned into another person.

You see this person, and tell them an embarrassing story. They say “Oh, that’s
horrible. No good person would do that — you are a bad person. Everyone knows
now”. If another person said this, wouldn’t you think they were weird and
mean?

What if instead they said: “You know, I know you felt scared there. It’s okay
— most people have gone through this. It’s going to be tough, but you’ve got
this. At the end of the day, you know you are a good person, everything is
okay, and you will do the right thing”

Now, that sounds like someone who’s _truly supporting you,_ and is seeing a
more holistic perspective.

Train your mind gradually, to speak to you as a _reasonable, kind person._

The way I do this:

Anytime I sense a cycle of negative thoughts, I open up a notebook and write
them all down. Then I start critiquing and fighting back, as if someone else
said those things. Eventually, you start internalizing it, and the fighting
back happens immediately

 _Funny side note: as you do this more, some people will see you differently,
in good and bad ways. When someone hears “Oh, yeah, I lost this much last
month, made this mistake, but yeah, meant for greatness over here, so no
worries”, they may think you have a bit of an ego — which may be true 😂_
