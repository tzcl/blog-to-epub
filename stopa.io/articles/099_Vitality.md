# Vitality


When I have the most fun, I’m doing a lot, I’m on the attack, having fun,
trying to be the best at everything I do. Trying to bite off more than I can
chew.

I wonder how life would be like if I could just live like that forever. It
might be worth a try. I don’t want to get tired, or discouraged. It’s almost
like I wish I never even heard of those words, so I wouldn’t try to fit my
thoughts into them.

If I didn’t know what depression meant for example, anytime I felt low I could
just think I needed to workout more. That might be more correct anyways!
