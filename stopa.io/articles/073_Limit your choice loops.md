# Limit your choice loops


One of the biggest drain on our energy and satisfaction is having open
decision loops.

What I mean by that, is any choice that you’re unsure about, and keep on
thinking about it in the back of your mind. The back of mind thinking reduces
your satisfaction, and doesn’t contribute to a clearer choice.

Another version can be having to think about a choice that you can’t act on
yet.

Both of them are fruitless to think about, as they don’t increase your
effectiveness at all, they only contribute to overwhelm.

To have a better time with them, attempt to close open decisions as fast as
you can, and prevent yourelf from thinking about decisions that you can’t make
yet.
