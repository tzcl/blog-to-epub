# When to fight


What I’m going to say is controversial, but it’s been one of the biggest
advantages I’ve been able to gain, and I see people I love making the same
mistake I was.

When I was young, If someone treated me badly, wronged me, or did something
wrong, I’d unsheath the sword and fight.

This can be fine if you pick one thing, and you devote your entire life to it.
If you see something wrong with the world, and you fight to correct that
wrong, it’s a noble pursuit that’s worth taking up.

But, what if your interests lie elsewhere? What if you want to be the best
craftsperson, or a business person, doctor?

With every fight you open up, you have to devote resources to winning it. If
it’s something that society at large believes, then you’ll have to deal with
ostracization effects.

The common response when this happens is ‘I don’t care’. Oh whatever, I lost X
deal, but I don’t care, she did Y thing wrong.

There’s a fine line here — you can’t ever cross your morals, or let anyone
else beyond boundaries you’re comfortable with. However, if you don’t want to
devote yourself completely to the fight, don’t dive completely into it. Use
the metaphorical ‘counter’. Deal with it swiftly, ignore the jabs and act
quickly to get what you want and end the fight.
