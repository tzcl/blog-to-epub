# Empathetic cool


Recently I saw a disagreement two people I loved, and I just yelled at both of
them.

That only makes it worse, embarrasses both of them, and entrenches them in
their choices even more.

Instead, I should have practice empathetic cool. Not getting angry, but
lovingly showing them the reason each person was acting the way there were.
