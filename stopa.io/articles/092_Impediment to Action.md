# Impediment to Action


What do you do when something unfair happens to you?

First, remember that all impediment to action reinforces action. Use this to
make you stronger. Get much better.

Second, use this as an opportunity to practice your ability to handle
wackiness. Everyone can be a CEO when it’s smooth sailing. This is your chance
to prove to yourself that you can be creative, you can deal with hard things.

Third, find opportunity from constraint. Okay, if X won’t work out, let’s ask,
why did you want it? Because of Y. How can we get Y?
