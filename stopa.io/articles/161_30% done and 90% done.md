# 30% done and 90% done


There’s two points where it’s critical to ask for advice from people you
respect.

The 30% stage, where you would be happy to change direction completely, and
the 90% stage, where you’re looking for the final polish.

The 30% stage is the most critical one, but I seldom see people doing it. If
you ask at 90%, it doesn’t make sense to give feedback that would require
changing everything, and that’s the most valuable type of feedback.
