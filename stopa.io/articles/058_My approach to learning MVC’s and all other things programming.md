# My approach to learning MVC’s and all other things programming


One of the best ways I’ve found to learn new programming techniques is to
break them out into a curriculum like structure.

 **First, scower the web for preparation material.** The best place to start
is usually their documentation. Use that as your base material for the
‘preparation part of the day’

 **Second, scower the web for DIY material.** Find the build X simple thing
using Y style tutorials.

Put out a day by a day plan, that should look like this —

about 2 hours worth of plain preparation material. I.e reading documentation.

Then 8 hours worth of doing material — I.e build x thing with Y.

 **Third, in about 3 days do a final project.** This is something you thought
of yourself. It should be simple, but enough to stretch your muscles. If you
can build it, you’re on a good start. If you can’t, repeat the previous
process.
