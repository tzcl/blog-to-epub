# When you don’t know, work


Daniel Burka told me something that has stayed with me, when faced with
tribulations in career-related stuff.

Just work. Get better.

In the end, that’s all that matters. Credentials are a pointer to how good you
are. But, you could also become really fucking good.

I’m nowhere there yet, but I believe in work. When something goes bad, just
fucking work! :D
