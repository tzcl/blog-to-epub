# The Alarm


One day, you wake up and hit snooze on your alarm clock. Is this day any
different from another day? If not, youâ€™ve just committed to snoozing on the
alarm clock for the rest of your life.

This is something I try to remember when faced with small, seemingly
inconsequential but actually dangerous moves in life.
