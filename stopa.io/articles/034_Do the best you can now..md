# Do the best you can now.


Oh the standards that we can have.

Whether it’s the quality of your work, or the type of life you lead, there’s
always a dream of what that ideal is.

The worst thing you can do is to avoid everything that doesn’t hit your ideal.
Let’s face it, even if you were hit with your ideal right now, you couldn’t
handle it.

You can get there though. Start by enjoing and taking advantage of all the
opportunities you have now. Your standard of opportunities will naturally come
from there, and you will be ready for it.
