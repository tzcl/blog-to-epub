# Feeling Success, Being Successful, Having other people think you’re successful


All of these goals are exclusive to each other. When you work on feeling
successful, you’re not necesarily being successful. When you work on making
other people think you’re successful, you’re not being successful.

And there are 24 hours in a day. Where do you want to focus most of your time
on?

To be honest, I’m not sure where the answer is.
