# A habit of tracking core work


It’s been reaffirmed to me over and over again, that it’s consistent, focused
practice that leads to improvement and mastery. It’s when you are working on
what you don’t know yet; stretching.

It’s also this improvement, and knowledge that you will become better, that is
instrumental to overcoming hurdles.

It can be immensily useful to track this! Every week, how many hours of
focused practice am I putting in? I can take solace in the number, I can be
inspired by that number. Right now I’m not sure what that number is, or how
I’ll implement it, but I wanted to write this down to start to get a sense for
it.

 **A potential formula**

 _After riffing on this a bit, here’s a potential structure —_

Every day, put in 3 focused hours to working on a hard coding problem, or
learning a new technology.

Find a place where you will only do this; There should be no distraction, and
it should be easy to start

Figure out what you want to work on before starting out on the 3 hours

I feel like this is most applicable to me in my technical skillset, but I
couldn’t see why a business oriented person couldn’t adopt the same strategy.
