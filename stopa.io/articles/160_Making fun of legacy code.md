# Making fun of legacy code


It’s universal amongst programmers to complain about the codebase they’re
working on — if only we could rewrite it we say.

But, this doesn’t seem genuine to me anymore. It seems like it’s a lack of
confidence, of our ability to understand the codebase. We want to feel like
the reason this is hard is because of others, not because we don’t know, and
we’re looking for validation.

None of that is good or useful.
