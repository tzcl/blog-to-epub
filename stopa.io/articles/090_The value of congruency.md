# The value of congruency


When we’re kids, it’s easy to think that everything you think is the right
choice and you’re making a hero’s decision.

How do we know? The fact is that as a kid you don’t actually make any
decisions, so you never know how you’ll actually act. You are good in all
aspects, but it’s an unprovent type of good.

I got really lucky in that I had excellent mentors when I first ventured out
into business. You’ll inevitably be confronted with situations were you could
easily convince yourself to let your values slide; in the moment it won’t even
look like it. If you let it, your brain will be quick to make a
rationalization.

But, this is where you define the type of person you are. It’s immensley worth
it to make the right choice. How much is it worth to you to be incongruent
with who you are?

The answer for me is that congruency is priceless. I’ll write a bit more on
this later, but in short, it offers excellent value. The first is that you
will be happy with yourself, you will honestly be someone who you yourself
respect. The second, is that you will build up your ability as stakes get
higher, and making the right choice there will create immense wins for you.
