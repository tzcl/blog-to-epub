# Defining Success


Take a minute to think about this question.

What is important to you in your life?

What are your values?

What will make _you_ happy?

What type of person are you, and what type of life do you live 20, 10, 5 years
from now?

Wether we like it or not, we already have answers to these questions. Moms,
dads, friends, celebrities, writers, they’re all giving us answers to these
questions. These questions define our idea of success.

The problem when we don’t have our own answers to these questions, is that
we’re susceptible to any answer.

Like a kid on ADHD, we jump from answer to answer, saying yes to our moms,
dads, friends, and going through this repeating event.Jumping from one goal to
another, and another, without completing either one.

Ponder deeply about what makes you happy, and what success means to you. When
you answer these questions yourself, you can start to say no. You will know
when you’re on the right track and when you’re not, and you can go without
taking detours on every person’s whims.
