# Don’t be daunted


This happens to me every time I tackle a project.

My head starts swimming, running through what I’ll have to do. The project
expands and expands, until it becomes a massive monster. At some point my mind
gets caught up, and I get this weird, ugh, I can’t do this feeling.

And once I get started it gets done in a day.

It so simple that we’re averse to it: When taking on large projects, just
think about the next step.

Our culture celebrates cerebral thinking, but we shouldn’t use it where it
isn’t useful.

Just think about the next step! It will get done faster and better, with less
overoptimization
