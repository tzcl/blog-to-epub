# how other people view you | how you view other people


Let’s take an arbitrary fact about the world: People will judge you by the way
that you dress.

Now, what if you don’t believe that superficial appreances are the best way to
judge people?

The gut reaction is to just wear whatever you like. But that’s going to impede
you in getting what you want in the world.

The answer that I’ve come to is this —

Dress well, because you can’t control how other people judge things. But, hold
strong in your conviction — never judge someone else based on their
appearance.

I tend to generalize this thinking into most beliefs.
