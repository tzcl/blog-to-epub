# You choose how you react to things


Something interesting happened to me the last week. I had some trouble
securing a flat in Taipei, and I bubbling with infuration about it for the
last week. I didn’t want to think about the situation, and I got angrier and
angrier that I had to think about it. I focused only on the negative side of
what happened.

But, life isn’t so black and white. I feel like almost any circumstance has a
spectrum of emotions, and if we choose to, we can occupy ourselves 24/7 with
the positive spectre. I don’t mean just blissfuly ignoring things, more ‘doing
what needs to be done’.

If it happened, and you have to do it, why not be happy about doing it?
