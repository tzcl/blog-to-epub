# Jumping thoughts


One pattern of thought I’ve noticed that is particularily unproductive to all
that is good is chronic thought switching.

You have 4 things to do. You start on the first thing, but by the time that
you start, you start thinking of the second thing, and it continues in a
circle.

It can drain your energy and morale.

When this happens, acknowledge it, and know that even though it’s hard, if you
force yourself to just do one thing, you will feel much better
