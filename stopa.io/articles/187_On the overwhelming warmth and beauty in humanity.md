# On the overwhelming warmth and beauty in humanity


As we introspect, the world separates from us. We start asking, what do we
want? We almost dehumanize those around us. But if we open our eyes, we start
see expressions on people’s faces. We start to sense the emotions they feel,
when they wonder what we’re thinking. At that moment, it’s almost silly. Wow,
how together we really are, how much of the human experience we really share.
