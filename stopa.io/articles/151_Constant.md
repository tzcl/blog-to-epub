# Constant


Constant happiness Constant wealth Constant emotions Constant conversations

I remember my first time riding a horse. It was with business partner and
friend in Mongolia. He was Mongolian, and he really knew how to ride his
horse. He got on, and started galloping.

I think my horse liked his horse, because as soon as his horse started
galloping, myne started galloping too. The constant movement made it
impossible to sit on the horse, I had to stand. Immediately, there was fear. I
looked down, the ground blurring, and it wasn’t too hard to imagine falling
under.

But, there comes a choice. You can embrace the anxiety, embrace the moment,
and allow yourself to enjoy it.

Instead of dreaming for what is constant, let’s dream to be able to live with
constant change.
