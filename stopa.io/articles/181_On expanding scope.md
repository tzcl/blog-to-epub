# On expanding scope


I reflected recently about the moments where I felt the happiest. The moments
where I saw the largest gain, or experienced person growth. During these
moments, the one constant was that I was thinking about something greater than
myself â€” family, team, friends.

Then I thought of the moments where I was the closest to causing irreparable
damage. In these moments the constant was that I was internally focused,
worried about myself, anxious.
