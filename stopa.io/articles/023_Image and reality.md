# Image and reality


I’ve noticed in my life, and in the lives of many others, there’s two
motivations for doing something. The first, is to preserve an image of
yourself. The second, is to build the reality that you’d like to live.

Often, however, building your reality endangers the image you have of
yourself, because you see very clearly where you’re at currently.
