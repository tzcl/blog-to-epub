# The Uselessness of Guilt


How many times have we said ‘Yeah, I should really run more’, or thought
ceaselessly over the unanswered emails we have lingering in our inboxes.

After feeling the guilt, how many of us have actually gone up and went
running, or cleared our inboxes? Never.

Guilt simply mixes into your habits, so instead of just not doing something,
you don’t do something and feel guilty about it.

Ramit Sethi talks about this extensively, and it finally hit me.

It’s not guilt that forces you to change your behaviour, but external
triggers. Signing up for a personal trainer for example.

When you’re feeling guilt or anxiety, stop feeling it, and ask yourself, ‘why
am I not doing that right now?”. Find an answer, and the next day work to
create a remedy for it.
