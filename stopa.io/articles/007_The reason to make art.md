# The reason to make art


I’m about to head over to a negotiation right now. It’s with a boutique hotel
we made a service trade with, and I’m a bit underslept and tired. I opened up
youtube, and listened to some techno.

This is why push ourselves to make something great. The art the person made
helps me, and helps people see reality. I hope I can do something like that
for those who I care for.
