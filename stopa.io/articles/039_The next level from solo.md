# The next level from solo


A lot of us in technology have started businesses when we were younger, and it
gave us the generalist skillset necessary to build prototypes.

But, there’s another level. Focus on doing something excellent, and get a lot
of people involved in the work that you’d like to accomplish. A professional
photographer, a copywriter, an ops person, a designer, a coder.

These are the people who come together to build the sites we admire so much.
The value from the finished work when collaborating with masters, as you would
imagine, is on a completely different level, and offers completely different
rewards.
