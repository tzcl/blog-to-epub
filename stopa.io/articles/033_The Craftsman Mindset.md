# The Craftsman Mindset


As young people, half of our day fills by anxious thoughts about the future.

We want to somehow guarantee it, and we use selling ourselves as a way to do
it. It’s easy to fall into the trap of “How can I convince other people that I
am a superstar?”

The reason it’s a trap is because it will never releave the anxiety, because
if you are not useful, not excellent at what you do, than you are not a
superstar and that anxiety will never disappear. Selling yourself is an ever
thinning veil.

Instead, remember that you have what it takes, and it will take time. Do
things that will push you to grow your skillset, your ability to lead, learn
and follow.
