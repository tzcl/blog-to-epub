# The Last 10%


Pouring your heart into a deal. You do well getting their needs, the offer is
tight, you’re very friendly and you’ve developed great rapport. It’s getting
close to descision time, and the anxiety is rising with every call. You do
what’s in your understanding, and yet…fwooop.

After 90% of the way there, there’s 10% you don’t know. The deal falls
through, but you can’t pinpoint the reason why. Was it your followthrough? Did
you speak to the wrong person? Did you not get her buying criteria correctly?
Was there no reason to close now?

You know you did something wrong, but it’s _just_ outside your mindspace.
This, for me, is the most frustrating experience in business, sales, and life,
to be honest.

It’s what I think makes a lot of people stop midway. It sure has made me
question a lot of what I do. The feeling of helplessness, after being 90%
there, and fwoop.

But, I’ve realized something. I think that last 10% is ten times harder to
acquire then the first 90%. That’s why there’s so much more reward after
getting it.

If you want to get where you want to go, and you want to stay sane along the
way, I think it’s absolutely crucial to develop a sense of contentment with
the 90%. An understanding that because you did all that work doesn’t entitle
you to the gains of 100%. It’s going to take time, ten times more time, and
ten times more work, to get the last 10%.

I’ll even add one thing to make you happier. I’d look at every time the deal
falls through, as something to be thankful for. Those moments are what are
going to show you what’s missing.
