# On Fairness


In the tech industry, employees often feel slighted by the world, perceiving
an “unfair” environment. They see people who make millions around them, or
negotiated twice their RSUs, and feel that the tech industry is broken. The
feeling is akin to oppression almost, and the drive moves towards
unionization.

To turn things around, maybe the concept of fairness is broken. From where in
nature has fairness ruled? Where has fairness produced optimal outcomes?

It’s hard to make this suggestion. If you feel angry I’m making this
suggestion, take a moment to think about it. Maybe this drive to fairness is
limiting you, maybe it’s stopping you from seeing the paths that ultimately
lead you to your goals.
