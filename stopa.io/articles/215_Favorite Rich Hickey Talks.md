# Favorite Rich Hickey Talks


Within our team some of Rich Hickey’s idioms and thoughts have become a
superpower and a secret language. Rich’s thinking on system design and problem
solving is profound. I think the lessons there can transfer to other facets of
life too. For posterity, sharing some favorites:

On thinking through tough problems

[Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)

On avoiding dogma and writing truly simple programs

[Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)

Some favorite talks, just on programming

Comparing programming language design with system design

[Language of the System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROor6_NGIWU)

Thinking about the most robust way to build for concurrency

[core.async](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/clojure-core-async)

 _(there’s too much on just programming, so will rewatch them at some point,
and maybe update with what I really loved)_
