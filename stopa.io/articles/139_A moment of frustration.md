# A moment of frustration


Her: “I’ve written it all down. I’m the type of person that gets everything
that she puts her mind to it done”

Me: “No you’re not, everyone thinks that, you can’t leave it to your
willpower. Change your environment!”

Her: “How could I? I have duties to others”

Me: “No, this is hopeless, unless you change your environment!”

I see myself in her, or maybe herself in me. I want her to succeed, but I
don’t know what to say. It surely can’t be threatening — “if you don’t do it
this way, then it’s impossible”. People don’t change this way. How do they
change though, I’m not sure I have the answer to that.
