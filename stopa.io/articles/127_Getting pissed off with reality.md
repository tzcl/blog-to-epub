# Getting pissed off with reality


Among my friends I’m known to be horrible with errands. Not the ha ha kind of
horrible, like I can’t get myself to buy a bed for my awesome apartment kind
of bad.

If I didn’t have roommates, I don’t think I’d have registered for internet
either.

This has been the latest personal goal I’ve been on, to identify why I do this
and to fix it.

I think I may have gotten a clearer understanding today. Today I woke up and
was ready to start on a project I was excited about. But, the development
environment, which wasn’t set up by me, was having trouble.

It’s stupid, but I got so frustrated that it was an effort not to show my
dissatisfaction (I’m pretty sure it showed anyways). Typing was annoying.

Why?

My thought process was “Why is this happening?”. “This shouldn’t even be
happening”. “F _*_ ”

I was dissatisfied with the reality of the situation, and I was defaulting to
ignoring my way through. Of course, that’s not going to fly. This might be
similar to errands. I think, ugh, why is this not done, it should just be
handled.

Time to grow up a bit I guess. No one will handle these things for me.
