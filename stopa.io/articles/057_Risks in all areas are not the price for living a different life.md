# Risks in all areas are not the price for living a different life


I was reading Tynan’s posts <http://tynan.com/precarious>, and had to disagree
slightly with him here.

It’s not necessarily the price to pay. I think it’s very unhealthy to have all
areas of your life in a risk state. Rather, have a bunch of risks, downplayed
by a bunch of safe bets. I would actually argue that him living in an RV, even
with the possible trouble with the parking spot is a very safe bet, when
compared to paying 3k/month in an SF flat. It’s what allows him to take the
other bets.
