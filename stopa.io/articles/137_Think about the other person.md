# Think about the other person


It’s a very North-American, or “macho” thing to just do whatever you want.
This can get you far if you’re 15, and almost everything you’re supposed to do
it pointless, but it can be destructive as you grow older.

Let’s say a friend invites you to a restaurant, and the waiter is incompetent.
What do you do?

If you do whatever you want, you can just insult the waiter.

But, your friend invited you. What if he frequents this place? It’ll suck for
him.

I see this in myself quite a bit, and I can see the downsides. You’ll get less
introductions and invitations, because your friends won’t know how you’ll act.
