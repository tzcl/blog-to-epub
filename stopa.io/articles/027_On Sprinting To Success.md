# On Sprinting To Success


Sometimes, it feels like I’m panting. I look around, and see other people
panting. Running, running with all intensity. With only one thought, “When
will I succeed, so I don’t have to be running anymore?”.

Okay, let’s get into Oxford. Okay, let’s sell a company for a million dollars,
let’s buy an investment condo.

What do we think is going to happen when we reach that success?

There’s so much beauty to see, but we’re busy running. We can’t sleep, because
we need to be running. When we eat, we think about running. It’s not a real
thought, but an undercurrent to all of our thoughts. This belief in the very
back of our heads.

So far, I’m confused about this. I think about this alot. Now, to figure out
how to sleep soundly.
