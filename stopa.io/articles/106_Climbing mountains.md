# Climbing mountains


If I read this title, I would think it’s some metaphor for some cerebral
‘climbing of mountains’, but nope, this post is not that.

As ambitious / technical people, there is such a thing as too much focus. When
you want to derive all your happiness from one thing. I contend that it’s not
possible. We should climb mountains too, we should be with our family,
exercise our bodies, travel, learn different languages, and inhale all of
life.

But, our craft can not be hurt by this. It needs to be nourished by this. Now
off to figure out how to do that :P.
