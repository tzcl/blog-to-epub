# Default State


This seems obvious, but was a mind shifter for me, when I first heard it said
this way —

There’s execution mode, and there’s planning mode.

Your _default_ state should be execution.

You should feel viscerally that progress only happens in execution mode, not
in planning mode.

Make a decision in planning mode, then get heads down in execution mode. Don’t
question your plan until you’ve accomplished the objective, or something
completely blocking happens. Don’t re-evaluate until then.
