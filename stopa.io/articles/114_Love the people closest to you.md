# Love the people closest to you


The people closest to you are the ones that can take your bullshit the most.

If you’re not concious about this, on autopilot you’ve probably given them a
lot of bullshit. Don’t tear the most precious thing you have.

Follow up, do what you say, always, keep them top of mind, help them,
compliment them, be there for them.
