# The Hacker Way: How I taught my nephew to program


Over the last year, my 13 year old nephew developed a love for hacking. From
[anime chat](https://anime-theory.web.app/), to
[snake](https://snake-a2aef.web.app/), a [minimal twitter](https://ilia-
python-tweet.herokuapp.com/), a [blog](https://ilias-blog.web.app/), to an
[anime music
startup](https://twitter.com/stopachka/status/1289945194411036675), he‚Äôs built
some cool stuff (1). What I‚Äôm most proud of though, is that he‚Äôs done this
with self directed play, rather than with a rigid curriculum.

To help him do this, I acted as a yoda in the background. I experimented with
a personal teaching philosophy, and I wanted to share the core tenets with you
‚Äî I call it ‚ÄúThe Hacker Way‚Äù:

### Principle A: Learning is Play

Kids are taught to associate learning with responsibility. Learning is stuff
you don‚Äôt want to do, but have to because it‚Äôs either good for you or will
make your parents happy ‚Äî sort of like broccoli. With a belief like this, both
the kid and the teacher are playing life on hard mode. The kid will lean
towards the bare minimum. They won‚Äôt have any desire to self-direct and look
deeper. The teacher has to constantly push the student along.

This method is disastrous for mastery. Mastery requires depth, and you‚Äôd need
a kid with incredible self-disciple, and a teacher with an incredible amount
of time, to reach the kind of depth mastery demands. Imagine the alternative:
what if the kid was genuinely interested? All of a sudden, learning is play,
and depth is exploration.

My primary goal throughout every one of our conversations was to help him
cement this view: learning is play. So, how do we do that?

### Principle B: Meet them at their interests

Well one of the key differences between play and work is freedom: play happens
when you‚Äôre doing what you want to be doing. This means, you need to make sure
that the kid is working on what they‚Äôre _actually_ interested in. Even though
you know, that if they just hung on for some time, they‚Äôd learn to love it,
it‚Äôs more harm than good: it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll persevere and regardless
they‚Äôll remember the pain.

The solution to the problem is to meet them where they‚Äôre at, and guide them
from there. For example, say you want to get a kid to read books. Well, if
they like cartoons now, what if you suggested anime? (japanese tv shows). If
they love the anime they‚Äôll soon discover manga (japanese comic books). Once
they read a bunch of manga, all of a sudden reading is something they like to
do. What if you threw in some adventure novels after that, like Dune? Slowly
but surely they‚Äôre on the road to voracious reading.

The key idea to notice, is that we expect kids to grok ideas that are several
steps away from their development. If you observe what they‚Äôre interested in
right now, _then_ form a plan from there, it‚Äôs going to be a lot more smooth.
This requires patience, but that is the reality of things.

For my nephew, programming started out as drawing. I knew he liked to draw. He
began designing apps with paper and pencil. So I got him sketch. and sat him
down one day to show him the basics. He was into youtube, so he started
designing banners. With that, he had a joyous entry point.

So, it was smooth sailing from there, they saw that work was play?

### Principle C: Let kids drop things

Not quite. The other difference between play and work, is that you can stop
playing any time. It‚Äôs common amongst older folks to teach a kid something ‚Äî
especially if they pay for some item ‚Äî and then expect that the kid will
devote themselves seriously to it.

This of course, is never the case. Kids don‚Äôt know what they want and they
certainly don‚Äôt have large attention spans. The common adult reaction is to
guilt trip the kid ‚Äî you said you wanted this, and now it‚Äôs collecting dust.
The ostensible purpose is to teach a kid the value of a dollar, but I don‚Äôt
think this is what actually happens. Instead, they learn to avoid taking
risks. They may force themselves to continue on with that activity too, which
teaches them to dislike learning.

What if you encouraged the opposite? Any time you gave a gift, you said: hey,
if at any point this becomes boring, _promise me to stop and do something
else_. All of a sudden the pressure is gone. They can explore at their
leisure, discover more of what they like, and it becomes natural to come back
to things.

I did just this. With books, every time I suggested something, I told him to
only read when he felt like it, and to stop and do something else as soon as
he was bored. Lo and behold, he finished more books than I could have
imagined, and started to form his own taste.

With programming, after the youtube design, he had a bit of a lull, where he
focused on other things. Eventually though, curiosity and desire rose in him
again: how could he make these designs _real_? How could he make _real_
websites?

At this point, the desire was hot, and it was time to transform it forward. We
can teach them something now. But how?

### Principle D: Treat kids like junior apprentices

We teach kids in two common ways. The first is to form a ‚Äúclassical‚Äù
environment: you start from first principles, and guide them through the
fundamentals: what is a string, what is an array, etc. This is often the most
boring approach ‚Äî if a kid doesn‚Äôt understand why they need to learn
something, it‚Äôs much harder to learn it.

The second is to form a ‚Äúkid-size‚Äù environment: maybe a dummy programming
language that works on kid-style problems. This may be better than the
classical approach, but I think it still suffers from similar problems: the
kid doesn‚Äôt really understand _why_ they‚Äôre doing this. Most game-like tools
are less fun than real games too, so if they see this strictly as games‚Ä¶there
are much better options. (2)

An alternative method is to treat them with a bit more respect. What if you
treated them like an intern? Imagine how a kid would feel if they worked on
what the _pro adults did._ It‚Äôs intriguing, and it may even be something their
friends think is cool.

My working approach is to do just that and treat them like junior apprentices.
They get the same tools as adults: but like all apprentices, they need to
start by learning subsets first. For programming, I started by showing him how
to make a simple site with HTML and CSS. Just the basics ‚Äî enough for him to
make something.

With HTML & CSS he built a personal news site, a blog, a tic tac toe board,
and started doing his school projects as websites. He saw how this really did
_feel_ like the real thing ‚Äî it spiked his imagination and got him exploring
further.

Note, that like most apprentices, he did the majority of the research and
work: I simply gave the problems, and was available for video calls when he
got stuck. Those video calls were import though: Like a real apprentice I made
sure to treat his questions seriously, and gave him answers that satisfied his
curiosity. This also let me figure out what kind of project he could find
interesting next. The work itself was up to him.

Eventually, he wanted to make the news site do dynamic things: How can you
hide and show content? How can you make buttons work? Well, time to learn a
little bit of javascript. There‚Äôs a valley here ‚Äî he may need to understand
strings now ‚Äî but he‚Äôs built enough that he can probably stomach a few videos
on the fundamentals. With that, he‚Äôs off to the races ‚Äî until he decides to
work on something else for a bit of course üôÇ

### Fin

And that‚Äôs my Hacker‚Äôs Way. Instill in the idea that learning is play. Meet
the kid where they‚Äôre at, let them explore, and treat them like a junior
apprentice.

### Aside: a curriculum

I didn‚Äôt go too deep into the curriculum in the essay, because it depends on
the kid: where are they at, and what are they interested in now? Nevertheless,
to get a taste, here‚Äôs a small subset of how his exploration developed:

  1. Started off with Sketch. Made youtube banners, small site designs, etc
  2. Moved to HTML & CSS. Made a blog, a news site, a tic tac toe board, 
  3. Showed him how to deploy sites to firebase, so he could show his friends
  4. Could stomach some codecademy + youtube lessons, to learn some basics of javascript: strings, arrays, etc
  5. Guided him through a simple tutorial: given an input, take the value and make it the background color. This was one of the few times I actually sat down with him. He could use the ideas there to build a bunch more stuff
  6. He started building a bunch of javascript-enabled sites: cooler blogs, a todo app, an anime app, some school projects, etc
  7. Eventually, the curiosity came: how can I save data?
  8. Showed him how to use firebase. He went on a spree after that: built tic tac toe, snake, anime chat, etc
  9. Eventually, he expressed an interest in python. I challenged him to make a text-based twitter bot
  10. He wanted to turn it into an app, so he started playing with flask. I walked him through deploying it to Heroku
  11. Now he‚Äôs interested in building animusic: an app to let you list your favorite songs in anime.

 _Note, at some point, I may build something to help kids learn like this. If
you‚Äôre interested in that, follow me on twitter_ ‚Äî will announce if I do
anything there : }

(1) If you‚Äôre a hacker you may notice some glaring security vulnerabilities.
Please leave them alone, or if you like, hack with jest :}. Think a lesson on
security will get in the way for now

(2) Some environments, like Roblox, could be great: the motivation is real
(wow I can make a real game), and what they learn is real (Lua). One of my
other nephews is playing with this, let‚Äôs see how it goes : }
