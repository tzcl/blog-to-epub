# Presence and Technical Ability


I’ve been in a technical phase for the last while. The more deeply I learn,
the more prone I am to be incognicant of others, and unable to cultivate deep
centreness and presence.

I wonder why. I think what we normally consider balance might be antithetical
to deep technical work. When you’re working deeply, you need intense focus,
and your brain needs to be immersed in a different world. It’s the opposite of
presence.

I don’t know how to deal with this realization. It isn’t worth it to be
present if I can’t get what I want, which is deep technical growth. But, deep
technical growth isn’t worth being irratable and constantly in a different
world.

If you’re somehow reading this, and you have thoughts on this, please send me
an email.

For the minute, I continue to ponder the right path.
