# Don’t wear trackpants when you want to get shit done


Okay, today, I got little done other then lose my wallet.

I reflected on it, and to be sure there’s a variety of reasons, such as not
having clearly defined goals, getting side tracked by losing a wallet, etc.

But, a really sneakily big reason whether it’s a result of the above or an
action of it’s own right, was that I was dressed slopily.

When getting shit done, there shouldn’t be much spent thinking about other
things, or fighting uphill for arbirtrary reasons. Making sure you take care
of all arbirtray reasons for maximal effectiveness.
