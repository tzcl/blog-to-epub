# Systems


When you build a system, you don’t just stop when it works once. The
complexity comes from building fault tolerance, scale, both in features and
usage, as well as reliability. We need to apply to that our lives. I often
find myself always at the beginning stage of building a system — ‘Okay, now I
will work out every day and wake up at 5am and rainbows all around’. What will
happen if I don’t? What will happen when it’s a bad day?
