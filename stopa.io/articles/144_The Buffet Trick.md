# The Buffet Trick


I remember watching an interview of Buffet and Gates, where Buffet gave this
advice, paraphrased —

Choose a person you really admire. Write down the qualities you like about
them. choose a person you like the least. Write the qualities that make them
that way.

Now, set goals for yourself, aim to be more like the person you admire, and
remove the qualities you share with the person you don’t.

Seneca also agrees — In one of his letters, he talks about how important it is
to have someone to look up to. It’s hard to make something straight without a
ruler.
