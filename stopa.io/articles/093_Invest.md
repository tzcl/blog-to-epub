# Invest


When young people think about investing, we think about someone wearing a
tuxedo talking about tax free savings accounts.

Tax free savings accounts are actually pretty awesome, but that’s not what we
we should be thinking about.

As young people, we don’t have much money that we can leverage for investment,
but we have something immesnley more valuable. We have time, and unending
drive.

How can we use this well? Well, we can draw from lessons used in investing
money.

When you’re investing money, the more you wait, the more time your investment
has to compound. That’s what we want for our time capital. There’s easy work
that pays a lot, and there’s hard work that can help you grow. Choose the
latter for as long as you can.
