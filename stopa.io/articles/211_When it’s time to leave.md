# When it’s time to leave


Often, I reflect on where our mission is at, and my personal goals. This can
lead to asking the inevitable question: _is it time to move on?_

Well, I reflected on this recently, and in the end, came up with a decision
set I go through — what matters and what doesn’t. Here it is :)

### First and foremost, what **does not** affect the decision

 **The Money** — _Ethics and relationships trump Money_

  * What is the point of money, if you sell your ethics for it? Over the long term, this will burn your self confidence and your relationships. By ethics, I mean, if you end up “resting and vesting”, becoming a negative influence on your team and culture.

 **The Inconvenient Things** — _Little things should never affect big
decisions_

  * The “I have rent to handle”, a “personal trainer to pay for” kind of stuff. Sure, it may be inconvenient, but these kinds of things have a way of working themselves out. Besides, there’s inconsequential when it comes to the larger problem.

 **What the Future Holds** — _Ambiguity is good, you will figure it out_

  * The question, well “what else would I do?”. This almost makes one feel stupid, as it seems weird to give the financial side up, without any competitive thing to do. But, this kind of thinking can get you stuck forever. Know you _will_ figure out what to do, and quite quickly at that, and this will have to happen at some point.

 **Fear completing your large projects** — _Large, ambiguous, hard projects
are where true learning comes from_

  * Sometimes, you may feel stuck with a large project, the desire to leave is caused by some sort of blame avoidance. Remember you can’t fool yourself, if the project fails _after_ you leave, that’s even worse. The best course of action is to share where you’re at.

### Now, what **does** affect my decision

 **Honor and Ethics —** _What is the best for my team?_

  * All in all, I want to do what is best for the team. Is staying, at the level of contribution you think you can make, good or bad for the team?

 **The Difficulty —** _In reality, what is the harder, more learning filled
path?_

  * In life, the long roads are often shorter, and what seems daunting is often the most personally rewarding. Learn to love these dangers and difficulties. When you ask yourself _What is more difficult_ — what’s the natural answer for you? starting the adventure now, or pushing through?
