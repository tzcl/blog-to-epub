# The ambitious person’s excuse


When you’re working on something, completely involved, completely devoted to
refining, getting better, it becomes easy to rationalize away anything else.

Friends, family, relationships, health? No time for it, focus. But really, is
there really no time? Why wait for everything to be set ablaze for you to
figure out? Is what you’re doing so important, that you can’t show your love,
or take a walk?
