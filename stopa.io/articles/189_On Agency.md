# On Agency


It is a beautiful realization, to see that every human around you, different
as they may be, experience the world in a fundamentally similar way. We are
all constrained by a lack prescient knowledge. None of us know the future, and
this means that your boss, you, and every human on this earth is on level
ground. There are of course differences in knowledge and leverage between
people, but when compared to prescient knowledge, it’s insignificant. This is
what allows young hackers to topple corporations. We are all working with
information, trying our best to adapt to a world that no one truly
understands.

For me, working with this belief has both increased my empathy and empowered
me. In this framework, the world is your oyster, at least as much as it is
someone else’s. Don’t wait for people to tell you what to do, _think_. What
are the opportunities at present? How can we be impactful? What leverage can I
use?

After starting to do this, you’ll be surprised to see many people you looked
up to are doing the same thing. It’s not prescient knowledge, but an honest
effort from humans to lead and adapt.
