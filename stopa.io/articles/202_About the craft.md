# About the craft


When we are in the process of honing our craft, the pursuit quickly becomes
“about the craft”. This is an excellent way to grow, but I realized, I grew
the most, when I wasn’t focused on the craft itself. I was more focused on the
people. I wanted to “take care” of my “patrons”. This desire infused the
energy, and the fun that was required to make large strides in my craft
