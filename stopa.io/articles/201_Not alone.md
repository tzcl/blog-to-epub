# Not alone


As humans, we draw distinctions between things. Living things and dead things.
Animals and humans. Humans and friends. Friends and family, and finally,
family and ourselves.

We draw these distinctions, based on a belief of ourselves as an individual,
acting _onto_ the world. We are somehow different from the world, forcing our
will onto it.

This can help you strive and, for the lack of a better word, conquer. However,
who is less alone then someone like this?

Instead, what if we were all a part of our whole? How can you conquer or go
against something, that you are also a part of? This is the Paulo Coehlo
vision, but I definitely felt it recently — instead of things being a battle,
it’s actually every single thing, evolving and nurturing “the soul of the
world” :P
