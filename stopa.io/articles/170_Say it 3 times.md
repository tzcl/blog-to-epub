# Say it 3 times


This is one of the biggest wins Iâ€™ve had recently.

When you speak, be aware that this is the medium where almost all the
information gets lost on the way. People will not understand you.

Instead of trying to say 10 things, and have people understand 2, say 3 things
three times and have people understand 3.
