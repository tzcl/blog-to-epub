> **Alert**: This is a MVP and still a work-in-progress but I wanted to share my current implementation. Sorry if too messy, but following the very YC advise: _"If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late"_.

Download the _complete collection_ of +200 essays from [Paul Graham] website and export them in EPUB, MOBI and Markdown for easy [AFK] reading. It turned out to be a whooping +478k words. I used the RSS originally made by [Aaron Swartz], `feedparser`, `html2text` and `Unidecode` libraries for data cleaning.

## Dependencies for MacOS

To create the EPUB/MOBI files you should have installed [python3.9], [pandoc] and [calibre] for Kindle readers.

```bash
brew install python@3.9
brew install --build-from-source pandoc
brew install --cask calibre
```

## Usage

Run the [makefile](./Makefile) in the root directory

```bash
make all
```
